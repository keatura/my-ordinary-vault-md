She was put into foster care when she was 9, after he family was slaughtered in a random frenzied werewolf attack, because one of the other families in the complex had a vampire who was recently turned and breaking the masquerade, alerting the werewolf. 

Afterwards, Wolfie found herself being roped into gang activity due to her shitty situation, looking for a place of belonging in a world where no one was there for her. While she is no longer on great terms with most of the people she met, she still has a few left.
