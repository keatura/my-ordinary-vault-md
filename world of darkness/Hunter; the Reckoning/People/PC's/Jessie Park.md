## Backstory
Ok so, Jessie and [[Natalie Park]] are siblings that share an unpleasant childhood. Their father was never apart of their lives and their mother struggled constantly with drug addiction and unemployment. They lived with their mother sometimes but were mostly passed around from foster home to foster home and eventually, Jessie (13) and Natalie (9) came to live with their grandmother and grandfather in [[New York City]]. Their lives got better after that, the grandparents were kind but were not very well off. They are first generation immigrants from Korea and own an Art gallery. Both Jessie and Natalie loved the gallery and were both pursued their love of art. They would sneak out all the time to do street art or they would make their own clays from the alluvial chunks that would wash up on the creek by their school. Jessie was the one that kind of had to raise Natalie. He understands her better than anyone and he probably the closest thing to a father figure Natalie has ever had. Even still, they both had some very serious mental issues. You see, growing up Natalie struggled constantly with depression, BPD, and frequent manic outbursts. Jessie has chronic depression and occasionally suffers breakdowns. Hallucinations are not uncommon for them.

They both inherited mental disorders from their mother, but Natalie definitely got the worst of it. Jessie does all that he can for her, but he could not stop her from sneaking out on her own. There were periods where she would be missing for days or even weeks. She always return home but not without a few new bruises and splinters. Neither Jessie nor Natalie did very well academically, but both excelled at the arts. Eventually Jessie got admitted to the New York academy of the arts. He loved large scale paintings and would do these enormous, unsettling murals of monsters, angels and dying people. Natalie had a more subtle style, she would use primarily red black and white in her pieces that had striking compositions and exaggerated angles. Jessie was hopeful for Natalie, even though she decided to skip on college, she was still making and selling her work and promised to stop running away. They had also finally got her prescription medication that seemed to genuinely help her. However, during the 3rd semester of freshman year, Natalie vanished for almost an entire year. There was no note, no warning, she just disappeared.

Jessie then suffered the worst depressive episode of his life. He was convinced she was dead, and multiple times considered suicide over waiting for a body to be found, if there even still was one. The only thing that kept him going was sheer stubbornness, and a greater fear of Death. However, one day, Natalie came home. Their grandparents were overjoyed and immediately called Jessie to tell him. Jessie ran home as quick as he could and he was euphoric to see her again, but he could also tell something was off. I mean, of corse she felt different she was gone for months, but there was something else Jessie couldn’t quite figure out. She was unnaturally cold, she carried with her this new charisma, and not to mention her eyes are now a completely different color. She was unconventionally calm and polite, without any of the punky charm from before. Jessie knew something was wrong, but his grandparents were ignorant of this change. He confronted her, asked what had happened during the time she was gone, and she, calmly, gave him a very vague and unspecific answer that angered Jessie, but pleased their grandparents. She stayed with them for 3 weeks, always leaving for “work” just before dawn and coming home after sunset. At one point Jessie even tried to follow her to “work” but was quickly lost amid a crowded subway station. At first he rationalized her as a victim to some sort of trafficking, but eventually he begun to notice things genuinely unexplainable. Empty UV bags hidden under a floorboard in her room, she burnt clothing in the empty dumpster by their house, she never touched a crumb of food or a drop of water and her new uncanny courtesy made Jessie’s skin itch. But there was one event that really tipped Jessie over the edge.

Stress had mounted in his chest and he decided to go drinking one night with a few of his friends, it was a good time but it barely took the edge off. He came home to the whole house asleep, accept Natalie, who stared at him from the kitchen when he walked though the door. Her body was obscured by shadow but her eyes were piercing him through the darkness. Something that looked kinda like this:

Jessie felt such a primal fear, a panic only pray animals feel when hunted by a predator. He ran and locked himself in his room and all rationality in his brain fractured. He thought she could be possessed by a Demon, or an evil spirit had come to occupy the home and it took the form of Natalie. He didn’t leave his room until morning, and (sleep deprived and hung over) raved to a Pastor and begged him to perform an exorcism and cure Natalie. He was, of corse, kicked out of the church, but that did not stop his resolve. He couldn’t bare the thought of spending more time at the house, the fear was overwhelming and he had to seek answers. He took 200 dollars, left a note for his grandparents, packed what he needed, and left. He took a subway out of the city, and mostly traveled by bus or on foot from then on. Eventually, after a few hundred miles, he finds his way to [[Detroit]]. He doesn’t know what exactly he’s looking for, but he knows he has to try and find a way to help his sister.
