Allen Miller is a middle-aged human mechanic, who owns a shop called Grease Guzzler's Auto Repair Shop.

 OK SO Jessies uncle, Allen Miller is a self proclaimed professional gambler. He works at a near by mechanic shop (your welcome) and smokes a ton of cigarettes bc he’s based (YOUR WELCOME!!!) he didn’t know abt Jessie and Natalie until they had moved in with their grandparents and they tried to get in contact with their father, Audrey Miller, who (for the sake of simplicity) is dead. He was genuinely overjoyed when he learned he had a niece and nephew, he would send them gifts and occasionally sent money to the grandparents to help when money got tight. Jessie grew up with letters and gifts from him, but neither him or Natalie ever met him so this would be a first. Make him just the most insane chain smoking wholesome chungus grease chugging gambling American mechanic EVER
