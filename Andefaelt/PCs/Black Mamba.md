- Human rogue
- iyamari military lore
- white rose is very important, still alive
- 

I'm going to give the vaguest outline since I'm a bit busy right now And then I'll send more detailed stuff soon

1. Probably various friends, a lot of them likely died in the mission. I'll give a few soon. Family: Father, younger brother, stepmother. Father is human, stepmother is elvish, brother is half-elf. Allies and enemies too important to give vague answers, will be more detailed soon.,
2. Previous standing in the military was high but not super high. High enough to be considered one of the leaders on the mission and known to be one of the top agents available (but not like infamous or anything). Low enough that he's obviously not giving orders outside of in combat. He probably would have been an agent from the beginning.,
3. My father did similar work to me, and was quite good at his job. Same with my mother, but she died when I was young. My father switched to a more administrative, officer role after this, but I still remembered the stuff he taught me.,
4. With his more magical-surrounded background, he's not too religious. He switches between superstitious and apathetic toward various religions, without discrimination. Except for Asyria. He thinks they're crazy. Values and other beliefs I'll do soon,
5. He's got mixed feelings toward Iyamari. He knows they didn't make the bomb, but they wanted it obviously. And while he didn't want them to have it, he understands why they'd want it. It isn't like it would ruin his country for him. For him, it's more of how they follow stuff up that'll determine his future feelings. So right now, it's up in the air.

## Short story - Superweapon Heist
So yeah, I'm thinking there's a big Asyrian ship transporting this antimatter bomb. It's a team operation - one party securing the weapon, one party securing control of the aircraft, etc

Only issue is, security was higher than planned. Mission control didn't understand the full scale of this weapon. Explains why Black Mamba was fine with following orders at first. As he explores the huge ship, he finds out that this thing is bigger than anyone could have anticipated.

It gets to a point where the ship is under full lockdown. Parts of the ships are erupting into gunfights, the mission looks like it might be doomed.
Black Mamba and his party (I'm imagining since it's a big ship that it was a large group split into smaller parties of like maybe 4 or smth, number is irrelevant but just for visualization) are possibly the only or one of the only parties remaining. That doesn't mean the other parties didn't help deal with many of the guards, but it's still tense. There are fewer guards, but as mentioned before these are strong guards. Hell, I could even imagine there being like one templar or something (perhaps not with their suit) overseeing this transport

Eventually, the party reaches the bridge and takes control. I'd imagine at this point, it's just scattered guards on the ship but only a few agents. I can totally see Black Mamba looking at the morse code being printed out as they all wait very tense - knowing that they still aren't safe even though most of the obstacles are dealt with. The look on his face turns to horror as he sees the message say BRING WEAPON BACK

The team is a bit divided. Two of them are fine with this. One of them doesn't particularly want to, but that's mainly because they don't think the group can take on a templar. But Black Mamba doesn't want to fulfill the mission for a different reason - nobody should have this weapon.

He's at a loss though. The goal of the mission was originally to take control of the aircraft - they were dropped off covertly, they don't have an escape ship or anything. If they had a ship, they probably would've been shot down from the beginning. So, Black Mamba hatches a plan.

There are two templars on the ship. Fortunately, one seems to be patrolling and one seems to be guarding. The 4 of them could probably take on 1 if they are smart about it - which is their job. So, with this, the party heads to the chamber where the bomb is being kept. Sure enough, as soon as the door opens, they're met with a hulking templar walking right at them.

The party splits up throughout the winding halls, diverting its attention. One of the agents is pulverized. Just 3 left, including Black Mamba. One of the other agents, White Rose, is able to kill the templar. They reach the chamber and realize that they aren't getting this thing anywhere. They'll need to bring the whole damn ship to Iyamari if they want the bomb. White Rose and the other agent are explaining their plan on how to do this, but Black Mamba is not listening. He looks at this huge bomb and visualizes islands exploding - towns vaporized. Vaporized...vaporized. He has his own plan.

Black Mamba agrees to White Rose's plans. She intends to disable the communication systems of the aircraft alongside the other agent. As they do this, Black Mamba rushes back to the bridge without the party knowing. And he makes a move that could mean life or death. To the nearest Iyamari ship, he sends out SOS.

Soon after he sends this message - unbeknownst to his party - the party disables the long range communications on the aircraft. Now, neither Iyamari nor Asyria will be disturbing him.

The agents get back to the bridge to meet with Black Mamba. White Rose starts to chart a course to the Iyamari base they were meant to reach - planning to intercept a fuel tanker on the way. But as this happens, there's a very clear message over the speakers - Prepare to be boarded. Fear not, we have a templar. This is very much reason to fear! Unless it was the plan...

The agents are furious and shitting bricks - it was hard enough with 4 of them to take on one templar. Now, it's 3 of them and they're low on ammo. Now they've got a ship docked on them too, they aren't going anywhere until they get them off.

White Rose is cocky. She's the most talented fighter on the team, and she plans to try and take out all the soldiers other than the Templar. Black Mamba convinces the other agent to be backup for her. This gives him the chance to continue his plan.

Sneaking past guards from the ship and the new soldiers, he returns to the bomb chamber. Examining the controls, he sees no release option. This wasn't meant to drop the bomb, just move it. But, that works. He wants the bomb to blow right here. There's only one big issue...his expertise is pretty focused. He's smart (okay 10 intelligence yeah, I'd imagine the explanation is that as I said, his knowledge is pretty specific. Kind of like how you've got people who know all the workings of their job and then don't know how to do a relatively simple thing outside of that), but not "rig a bomb to blow" smart. Looks like he'll have to cause an incident.

So, with that, Black Mamba had only one idea. A sinister plan. He couldn't guarantee the bomb would go off, but he could hope.
Collecting whatever he could, he got as many flammable and explosive materials near the fuel tanks.
Returning to the bridge, he found that it was empty aside from one person - although several newly dead soldiers were here. White Rose stood near the main console - gun pointed right at Black Mamba.
"I checked everything. There was a distress signal, and corpses don't tend to send messages. You're why Green Shadow's dead."
With this, Black Mamba got in a fight with White Rose. It was a brutal fight, and that's how Black Mamba got the scar on his face - just narrowly avoiding his eye. Black Mamba was just barely able to knock out White Rose, getting back to his plan. He only needed a little longer.

Speaking over the intercom, Black Mamba said that there was a situation in the Bomb Chamber - someone trying to sabotage it.
This partially worked. The remaining forces seemed to go toward the Bomb Chamber, and Black Mamba made one last run to the fuel tanks. Preparing a bomb with the longest fuse he could, he set it off and left it near his little arsenal. Then, he made a run for the bridge to ensure a final backup plan in case this failed.

Running back to the bridge, Black Mamba turned the controls to manual. They would not be going to the Iyamari base. No, this ship would be heading straight for the Blanket.
As he did this, he was prepared to make a run for the Asyrian ship to make his getaway. But he was stopped by a booming voice.

"Halt. Turn around, hands behind your head," said the Templar that the party had previously evaded

Black Mamba turns around, what's he gonna do, not? Bro's probably got a handcannon that'll just vaporize his head.
"Turn this ship around."
Black Mamba paused. If his timer was right...
"I said, TURN THIS SHIP-" HUGE EXPLOSION rocks the ship. Black Mamba plunges a rod into the control stick to keep it nosediving down, then dives out of the way. The sound of a gatling gun fills the air. Crawling through the bodies and under objects, Black Mamba finally reaches the door and slams it shut. Before he does this, he sees White Rose off at the edge of the room. It hurts him, but he can't go back for her. He closes the door and runs for the small ship that dropped off the new forces. The ship is tilting heavily down, and fire is roaring throughout the ship. The fact that it's still solid suggests that the bomb hasn't gone off. Good for Black Mamba, but he's hoping that'll happen by the time he's out of here.

Eventually, after an intense run, he finally reaches the ship. Getting coordinates prepared for the closest island he can, he detaches the ship and it begins to move.
"I don't think so." Another heavy voice booms from behind. Turning around, he sees another metal figure looming at the end of the hall. The Templar the reinforcements came in with. Fuck.

"You're taking us to the closest Asyria base. Then, you're coming with me."
Black Mamba obviously didn't really had a choice. There's no explosion that'll give him an out. Plus, this bridge was far smaller. Not much room to hide and get around. Changing the coordinates, he stood up and turned around.
"Drop your weapon." He dropped the revolver. He had a hidden dagger, but it wasn't much use. Not gonna get through a Templar's armor.
The Templar marched Black Mamba to the brig. As he looked through a window, he could see the burning ship plunging toward the Blanket. Seemed even if he was doomed, he managed to get his goal completed.

Black Mamba was essentially doomed. He had a templar right over his shoulder, and his only weapon would do nothing. If he could even get an opening, that was. He couldn't take down the machine...but perhaps he could manipulate the man.

"I assume you got my friend too?"
"What?"
"Oh, so you didn't?"
"What are you talking about?" The templar did not believe Black Mamba yet, but there was a twinge of doubt.
"There were a ton of us, most of us died. The two of us got to this ship."
"Where are they?"
"How am I supposed to know?"
As Black Mamba said this, there was a faint sound. A little trick of Black Mamba's.
"What was that?!!!" The templar shouted. Sounded like footsteps behind.
"You have any crew?"
"They all boarded your ship. You dirty bastard left before they could get back."
"Guess you got your answer to before then."
Completely surprised, the templar turned for just a moment to check the sound. As soon as he did this, Black Mamba leaped out of the templar's presence and bolted down a hallway.

Now, Black Mamba may have played that well, but that probably bought him about 2 or 3 seconds. Critical info ran through his head. The templar said the crew had all boarded. That's impossible - the ship wasn't small enough. There were probably a few civilians somewhere on this ship. Still, that took out the issue of running into armed guards. That did not take out the issue of a battle tank of a man chasing him at the present moment.
Running through the halls and avoiding some pistol shots, Black Mamba finally turned a corner and had a tiny bit of distance. Then, he remembered something. He'd been on this model of ship before. He knew where the glider suits were.
Quietly, Black Mamba was able to sneak to the side of the ship. There were plenty of suits, and he wouldn't have pursuers. So, narrowly avoiding the templar, Black Mamba got in a glider suit. Climbing out of the ship, he waited for the right moment. He remembered the map...but not too well. Given the time he had, he could wait until he could see an island. But right now, he couldn't.
These minutes of waiting were as stressful as his countless times of hiding in crates and behind corners as enemies looked for him.
Speaking of enemies looking for him!

There was the sound of a door opening. The templar knew where he was. He couldn't wait for a better opportunity. He had to go.

And with this, Black Mamba leaped off the ship toward the closest bit of land he could see. Worst case scenario, it was an Asyrian military base. Best case, it was a fringe town. He had to gamble.

And with that, after his glide, he tumbled to the ground. And he ends up on the island we'll be starting at.
# Other Notes
1. It's possible that Iyamari doesn't know about what he did. So he could work with them still, unless somehow his betrayal is revealed. Speaking of which.,
2. The possibility that White Rose survived and got off the ship could be interesting. Possible NPC who would have complex relationship with Black Mamba. On one hand, they have experience doing missions together and he did spare her life when she tried to kill him. On the other hand, they had a bit of a rivalry and he _did_ betray the mission. If she gets back to Iyamari, very good chance she'll snitch on him.,
3. Yeah, heat will be high.
