Personality Type 7(w8)-4-9, possibly schizophrenic to a degree, age 122, Born in Iyamari and moved to the northernmost city in Zevka around age 23. Got a job, saved money for a few years, and then moved to a village outside of the city to build a quaint little home in the forest. Maybe her sorcerer awakening was at the ripe age of 7, or at least she showed the average elvish innate magic but kinda exploded at 7 after [X] event. What if she had a terrifying encounter with a natural horror as a child, one that left her with a fearful respect and awe for Hemepha. After that, throughout her childhood she struggled to regulate and control her magical abilities, which could have resulted in her being ousted from her peers and community. Then as a young adult, she decided to bounce and ended up in Zevka. She apprenticed under someone, eventually becoming like family and adopting their last name after their death. They could have taught her how to use a focus and regulate the chaos. After their passing, Mizuki took the money she had saved and moved to the cabin in the woods. She’s chilled there for about a century until recently, when voices in her head began to appear and whisper things. She decided to visit a big boy temple of Hemepha to see what’s up.
