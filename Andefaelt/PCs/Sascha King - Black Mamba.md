- Human rogue
- iyamari military lore
- white rose is very important, still alive
- 30

I'm going to give the vaguest outline since I'm a bit busy right now And then I'll send more detailed stuff soon

1. Probably various friends, a lot of them likely died in the mission. I'll give a few soon. Family: Father, younger brother, stepmother. Father is human, stepmother is elvish, brother is half-elf. Allies and enemies too important to give vague answers, will be more detailed soon.,
2. Previous standing in the military was high but not super high. High enough to be considered one of the leaders on the mission and known to be one of the top agents available (but not like infamous or anything). Low enough that he's obviously not giving orders outside of in combat. He probably would have been an agent from the beginning.,
3. My father did similar work to me, and was quite good at his job. Same with my mother, but she died when I was young. My father switched to a more administrative, officer role after this, but I still remembered the stuff he taught me.,
4. With his more magical-surrounded background, he's not too religious. He switches between superstitious and apathetic toward various religions, without discrimination. Except for Asyria. He thinks they're crazy. Values and other beliefs I'll do soon,
5. He's got mixed feelings toward Iyamari. He knows they didn't make the bomb, but they wanted it obviously. And while he didn't want them to have it, he understands why they'd want it. It isn't like it would ruin his country for him. For him, it's more of how they follow stuff up that'll determine his future feelings. So right now, it's up in the air.
6. Black Mamba, for context, is fully human. Around 30. To compare ages, his dad was around 30 when he had him, and mother around 25. His mom died when he was about 13

## Short story - Superweapon Heist
So yeah, I'm thinking there's a big Asyrian ship transporting this antimatter bomb. It's a team operation - one party securing the weapon, one party securing control of the aircraft, etc

Only issue is, security was higher than planned. Mission control didn't understand the full scale of this weapon. Explains why Black Mamba was fine with following orders at first. As he explores the huge ship, he finds out that this thing is bigger than anyone could have anticipated.

It gets to a point where the ship is under full lockdown. Parts of the ships are erupting into gunfights, the mission looks like it might be doomed.
Black Mamba and his party (I'm imagining since it's a big ship that it was a large group split into smaller parties of like maybe 4 or smth, number is irrelevant but just for visualization) are possibly the only or one of the only parties remaining. That doesn't mean the other parties didn't help deal with many of the guards, but it's still tense. There are fewer guards, but as mentioned before these are strong guards. Hell, I could even imagine there being like one templar or something (perhaps not with their suit) overseeing this transport

Eventually, the party reaches the bridge and takes control. I'd imagine at this point, it's just scattered guards on the ship but only a few agents. I can totally see Black Mamba looking at the morse code being printed out as they all wait very tense - knowing that they still aren't safe even though most of the obstacles are dealt with. The look on his face turns to horror as he sees the message say BRING WEAPON BACK

The team is a bit divided. Two of them are fine with this. One of them doesn't particularly want to, but that's mainly because they don't think the group can take on a templar. But Black Mamba doesn't want to fulfill the mission for a different reason - nobody should have this weapon.

He's at a loss though. The goal of the mission was originally to take control of the aircraft - they were dropped off covertly, they don't have an escape ship or anything. If they had a ship, they probably would've been shot down from the beginning. So, Black Mamba hatches a plan.

There are two templars on the ship. Fortunately, one seems to be patrolling and one seems to be guarding. The 4 of them could probably take on 1 if they are smart about it - which is their job. So, with this, the party heads to the chamber where the bomb is being kept. Sure enough, as soon as the door opens, they're met with a hulking templar walking right at them.

The party splits up throughout the winding halls, diverting its attention. One of the agents is pulverized. Just 3 left, including Black Mamba. One of the other agents, White Rose, is able to kill the templar. They reach the chamber and realize that they aren't getting this thing anywhere. They'll need to bring the whole damn ship to Iyamari if they want the bomb. White Rose and the other agent are explaining their plan on how to do this, but Black Mamba is not listening. He looks at this huge bomb and visualizes islands exploding - towns vaporized. Vaporized...vaporized. He has his own plan.

Black Mamba agrees to White Rose's plans. She intends to disable the communication systems of the aircraft alongside the other agent. As they do this, Black Mamba rushes back to the bridge without the party knowing. And he makes a move that could mean life or death. To the nearest Iyamari ship, he sends out SOS.

Soon after he sends this message - unbeknownst to his party - the party disables the long range communications on the aircraft. Now, neither Iyamari nor Asyria will be disturbing him.

The agents get back to the bridge to meet with Black Mamba. White Rose starts to chart a course to the Iyamari base they were meant to reach - planning to intercept a fuel tanker on the way. But as this happens, there's a very clear message over the speakers - Prepare to be boarded. Fear not, we have a templar. This is very much reason to fear! Unless it was the plan...

The agents are furious and shitting bricks - it was hard enough with 4 of them to take on one templar. Now, it's 3 of them and they're low on ammo. Now they've got a ship docked on them too, they aren't going anywhere until they get them off.

White Rose is cocky. She's the most talented fighter on the team, and she plans to try and take out all the soldiers other than the Templar. Black Mamba convinces the other agent to be backup for her. This gives him the chance to continue his plan.

Sneaking past guards from the ship and the new soldiers, he returns to the bomb chamber. Examining the controls, he sees no release option. This wasn't meant to drop the bomb, just move it. But, that works. He wants the bomb to blow right here. There's only one big issue...his expertise is pretty focused. He's smart (okay 10 intelligence yeah, I'd imagine the explanation is that as I said, his knowledge is pretty specific. Kind of like how you've got people who know all the workings of their job and then don't know how to do a relatively simple thing outside of that), but not "rig a bomb to blow" smart. Looks like he'll have to cause an incident.

So, with that, Black Mamba had only one idea. A sinister plan. He couldn't guarantee the bomb would go off, but he could hope.
Collecting whatever he could, he got as many flammable and explosive materials near the fuel tanks.
Returning to the bridge, he found that it was empty aside from one person - although several newly dead soldiers were here. White Rose stood near the main console - gun pointed right at Black Mamba.
"I checked everything. There was a distress signal, and corpses don't tend to send messages. You're why Green Shadow's dead."
With this, Black Mamba got in a fight with White Rose. It was a brutal fight, and that's how Black Mamba got the scar on his face - just narrowly avoiding his eye. Black Mamba was just barely able to knock out White Rose, getting back to his plan. He only needed a little longer.

Speaking over the intercom, Black Mamba said that there was a situation in the Bomb Chamber - someone trying to sabotage it.
This partially worked. The remaining forces seemed to go toward the Bomb Chamber, and Black Mamba made one last run to the fuel tanks. Preparing a bomb with the longest fuse he could, he set it off and left it near his little arsenal. Then, he made a run for the bridge to ensure a final backup plan in case this failed.

Running back to the bridge, Black Mamba turned the controls to manual. They would not be going to the Iyamari base. No, this ship would be heading straight for the Blanket.
As he did this, he was prepared to make a run for the Asyrian ship to make his getaway. But he was stopped by a booming voice.

"Halt. Turn around, hands behind your head," said the Templar that the party had previously evaded

Black Mamba turns around, what's he gonna do, not? Bro's probably got a handcannon that'll just vaporize his head.
"Turn this ship around."
Black Mamba paused. If his timer was right...
"I said, TURN THIS SHIP-" HUGE EXPLOSION rocks the ship. Black Mamba plunges a rod into the control stick to keep it nosediving down, then dives out of the way. The sound of a gatling gun fills the air. Crawling through the bodies and under objects, Black Mamba finally reaches the door and slams it shut. Before he does this, he sees White Rose off at the edge of the room. It hurts him, but he can't go back for her. He closes the door and runs for the small ship that dropped off the new forces. The ship is tilting heavily down, and fire is roaring throughout the ship. The fact that it's still solid suggests that the bomb hasn't gone off. Good for Black Mamba, but he's hoping that'll happen by the time he's out of here.

Eventually, after an intense run, he finally reaches the ship. Getting coordinates prepared for the closest island he can, he detaches the ship and it begins to move.
"I don't think so." Another heavy voice booms from behind. Turning around, he sees another metal figure looming at the end of the hall. The Templar the reinforcements came in with. Fuck.

"You're taking us to the closest Asyria base. Then, you're coming with me."
Black Mamba obviously didn't really had a choice. There's no explosion that'll give him an out. Plus, this bridge was far smaller. Not much room to hide and get around. Changing the coordinates, he stood up and turned around.
"Drop your weapon." He dropped the revolver. He had a hidden dagger, but it wasn't much use. Not gonna get through a Templar's armor.
The Templar marched Black Mamba to the brig. As he looked through a window, he could see the burning ship plunging toward the Blanket. Seemed even if he was doomed, he managed to get his goal completed.

Black Mamba was essentially doomed. He had a templar right over his shoulder, and his only weapon would do nothing. If he could even get an opening, that was. He couldn't take down the machine...but perhaps he could manipulate the man.

"I assume you got my friend too?"
"What?"
"Oh, so you didn't?"
"What are you talking about?" The templar did not believe Black Mamba yet, but there was a twinge of doubt.
"There were a ton of us, most of us died. The two of us got to this ship."
"Where are they?"
"How am I supposed to know?"
As Black Mamba said this, there was a faint sound. A little trick of Black Mamba's.
"What was that?!!!" The templar shouted. Sounded like footsteps behind.
"You have any crew?"
"They all boarded your ship. You dirty bastard left before they could get back."
"Guess you got your answer to before then."
Completely surprised, the templar turned for just a moment to check the sound. As soon as he did this, Black Mamba leaped out of the templar's presence and bolted down a hallway.

Now, Black Mamba may have played that well, but that probably bought him about 2 or 3 seconds. Critical info ran through his head. The templar said the crew had all boarded. That's impossible - the ship wasn't small enough. There were probably a few civilians somewhere on this ship. Still, that took out the issue of running into armed guards. That did not take out the issue of a battle tank of a man chasing him at the present moment.
Running through the halls and avoiding some pistol shots, Black Mamba finally turned a corner and had a tiny bit of distance. Then, he remembered something. He'd been on this model of ship before. He knew where the glider suits were.
Quietly, Black Mamba was able to sneak to the side of the ship. There were plenty of suits, and he wouldn't have pursuers. So, narrowly avoiding the templar, Black Mamba got in a glider suit. Climbing out of the ship, he waited for the right moment. He remembered the map...but not too well. Given the time he had, he could wait until he could see an island. But right now, he couldn't.
These minutes of waiting were as stressful as his countless times of hiding in crates and behind corners as enemies looked for him.
Speaking of enemies looking for him!

There was the sound of a door opening. The templar knew where he was. He couldn't wait for a better opportunity. He had to go.

And with this, Black Mamba leaped off the ship toward the closest bit of land he could see. Worst case scenario, it was an Asyrian military base. Best case, it was a fringe town. He had to gamble.

And with that, after his glide, he tumbled to the ground. And he ends up on the island we'll be starting at.
# Other Notes
1. It's possible that Iyamari doesn't know about what he did. So he could work with them still, unless somehow his betrayal is revealed. Speaking of which.,
2. The possibility that White Rose survived and got off the ship could be interesting. Possible NPC who would have complex relationship with Black Mamba. On one hand, they have experience doing missions together and he did spare her life when she tried to kill him. On the other hand, they had a bit of a rivalry and he _did_ betray the mission. If she gets back to Iyamari, very good chance she'll snitch on him.,
3. Yeah, heat will be high.

# Family
- **Idris King** (around 60), Black Mamba’s father. Once one of Iyamari’s top agents, he was actually from Zevka which led to him being a bit of a gruff and cold person. After his wife’s death, he got moved up to become an officer - likely reaching a high rank. I’d imagine the equivalent of a 1 star general maybe. There’s a chance he’s got some secret business going on given his previous work. Black Mamba holds a bit of resentment toward Idris for a few reasons. Firstly, he moved on from his wife quickly. Second, he was quite strict and tough growing up. Not the end of the world, but ties into the third thing. Third, he was nowhere near this strict and tough with his second son - who he had after remarrying (soon after his first wife’s death). That being said, they don’t have a terrible relationship. Just tense. Tough love from Idris and whatnot. His code name was Skullhammer, pretty spooky.
- **Maria** (died around 40) King, Black Mamba’s mother. Also a very skilled agent, she was an Asyrian defect that joined Iyamari a while back. She died in a top secret mission (nature of her death has been kept secret, there’s a chance some fishy business was going on) against Asyria - part of the reason why Black Mamba has a vendetta against them (aside from also thinking their zealotry is both goofy and sinister). Her code name was Silent Dagger.
- **Isabella King** (relatively young elf, not sure exact age), Black Mamba’s stepmother. Not related to the military, she’s an elven sorceress native to Iyamari. Black Mamba has never gotten too close to her, and has always been a bit suspicious of her. She’s a nice person though and hasn’t really done anything wrong to Black Mamba.
- **Tanis King** (around 15), Black Mamba’s half-brother. They don’t interact a lot. Black Mamba is nice to him, but a little jealous at times. Idris is far more caring and far less strict. Some of it is due to Isabella’s calm nature, but that doesn’t change the bitter feeling for Black Mamba. At this point he doesn’t really care, he’s a full grown man.

# Friends
- **White Rose** (elf, equivalent of 30). This was an interesting relationship, they were friends but often disagreed and had a bit of a rivalry. As will be apparent, the agents almost always use their code names. Only with family do they really use their birth names. They often worked together, with White Rose having superior combat skills (particularly martial arts) while Black Mamba had better stealth and resourcefulness. As you know, they had a pretty brutal fight when she found out Black Mamba sabotaged the mission. As far as he knows, she could be dead. He left her alive and did hope that she made it off the ship, but couldn’t go back for her. He knows she’ll probably come after him.
- **Green Shadow** (human, about 35). Dead according to White Rose, he was one of the group members on the iconic mission. He had known Black Mamba for a long time, and often talked about getting out of active combat as soon as he could so he could start a healthy family. Still, he took his job very seriously.
- **John Krash** (half-elf, about 35). A friend of Black Mamba that’s outside the military. He’s actually committed several petty crimes, being a charlatan of sorts. Black Mamba jokingly holds that against him in exchange for free drinks at Krash’s pub. They’ve known each other for a long time, and have each other’s backs when possible. Only thing is, that usually just means Black Mamba having Krash’s back given the skill difference. He’s back in Iyamari.
- **Obed Greathorn** (blue dragonborn, about 40). An adventurer that got Black Mamba out of a tough situation one time. Black Mamba owes him a favor at some point, but in the meantime they’re friendly. He lives in Voxis.

# Allies
- **John**
- **Obed**
- **Red Rage**, an elvish agent who’s pretty much just getting started. He doesn’t really have much power or anything, but he’s a big fan of Black Mamba. Black Mamba makes fun of him for being a small guy hiding behind an intimidating code name, but tries to help him out and teach him when he can.

# Enemies
- Whoever is hunting him down
- Asyrian authorities, although they don’t know exactly who he is. More specifically, the crew of the sunk ship and the big templar on the small ship.
- White Rose, if she’s alive (hope she is, she would make a cool foil)
- **Mauric**, an Orc officer for the IAR. He’s an old guy and didn’t like Black Mamba from the beginning. No clear reason/incident, just butted heads and whatever.

# Beliefs & Values
- Doesn’t worship one god in particular. He respects the gods and all that, not wanting to get smited. I like the idea that he switches between being superstitious and skeptical - sometimes being the kind to leave an offering out and sometimes blatantly rejecting and ignoring it. Perhaps this has led him into trouble once.
- He does not like Asyrian practices. He thinks they are too zealous. To him, gods that want that zealotry are bad gods. Still, if he gets afraid that the god will be mad at him, he will say the complete opposite to save his skin.
- I’d consider him quite True Neutral - leaning good. He respects the principle of order and chain of command, but thinks that people need to have freedom to make the right decision when it's the right time. Hence, why he did what he did. Similar thing with neutral - he tries to do good when he can (you know, giving a beggar money and stuff) and avoids killing people he deems innocent. Still, he doesn’t have a big issue with killing people he deems a threat. When he gets very focused, he has even less of an issue. Sometimes he’s a bit petty too, but more mischievous petty than evil petty I’d say.
- His biggest values are Personal Loyalty, Justice, Life, and Loyalty in general. The reason I differentiate with personal loyalty and wider loyalty is his betrayal. He cares for his country, but puts the principle of innocent people above that. However, if he was in a situation where his friends were in danger, he would totally go Joel firefly on them. He cares about justice a lot too, it’s a big motivator for him.
- Loyalty to Iyamari is interesting. I’d still say he’s loyal, but he has questions. If in the past he’d listen without hesitation, he definitely won’t now. He would be happy to help them if they needed him, but what’s most important is how they proceed with what he did. Their actions against him will determine his loyalty going forth.
