- human fighter

Previous Standing in the Military: Joined the military when he turned 18, as to continue something of his father's legacy. Ezaren was a cavalier that fought in a battle resulting in some severe injuries, some being fatal if not for "Carver."

Howetown/growing up: Born in a small town within Iyamari; his father and older sister raised him in a modest home. With his father's former skills of being a former squire of Asyria, Ezaren got a small glimpse of what his father had previously pursued. With plenty of space, Ezaren had ample opportunities to grow his love for horseback riding. 

General Beliefs: Knowledge can break any nation, Do what I must and obey just authority, lay down our lives for that of others. Would pray to Ares or Kaine the most out of the pantheon. LIAR agent: Is still apart of the IAR, currently under the identity as a hired gun.
