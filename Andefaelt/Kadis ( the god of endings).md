Kadis, the Great Nothing, is the first god known to current civilization. Kadis' domain is that of endings, and is depicted as a sort of "puppet master" controlling the strings of fate, to eventually bring their life to a close and return to nothingness.

The proper way to refer to Kadis is just to use the name, pronouns and honorifics are avoided. If you wish to address Kadis is prayer or other means, you will refer to them as "Kadis", not Lord or Saint or any other titles. Kadis' power is both unmatched and mundane, and should respected as so.

Kadis is physically depicted as a slender, slightly curvy but still gender neutral form with a lack of defining features or hair, other than a thin nose and lips. Coming out from Kadis' eyes and around the skull are dozens of large fingers curving upwards into the shape of a crown, and along Kadis' body it is completely flat, from neck to feet, and on Kadis' back there are two large "wings" comprised of an unfathomable amount of arms, with each finger having a small silver string shooting out from it, representing how Kadis is connected to all things, and how all things must come to an end.
