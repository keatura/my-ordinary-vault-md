 The first bits of recorded history in Andefaelt is that of the Taeki Monastery. These include recorded accounts of battles, civilizations, and most important- the historical use of Relentium. The current calendar starts on the first year recorded by this monastery, and continues to the current day. The current year as of the start of the campaign is Year 1865.

-The first inter-island travel (Year 11)
The first occurrence of people splitting out onto other islands happened only 11 years after the first known recording of history. A Human by the name of Ulta Ceran, the first sorcerer, created a form of glider to carry himself on winds with the assistance of magic and Relentium to explore outwards.

-The start of the Thirty-years War (Year 1326)
The Thirty-years War was a war between Iyamari and Zevka, over land disputes on their borders. This led to a long, drawn out war tiring both sides and causing the complete destruction of Thrysta. The war did lead to the Zevkan invention of modern armored warships, but at that point in the war Zevka had already basically lost.

-The Battle of Thrysta (Year 1342)
Thrysta is the ancient residence of what is now the city-state, Voxis. During this battle, forces of Iyamari attacked the former city of Zevka during their war of the time period, and resulted in the complete destruction and razing of Thrysta, leaving ruined remains and an ashen wasteland, near uninhabitable. 50 years after this battle, the ruined island was returned to by settlers and found to be almost completely rehabilitated by some means, and also found the entire city of Thrysta almost fully buried underneath the land of the island. The battles victory on the side of the Iyamari sparked a downfall in the moral and power of Zevka, and ultimately lead to the loss on the side of Zevka. During this battle, the Grymblade, a weapon designed for Zevkan Royalty, was lost.

-The establishment of Voxis (Year 1692)
After hundreds of years, settlers came and built the start of a city on top of the ruins of Thrysta, sponsored by the noblewoman of Asyria, Julia Umberlain. Voxis' central keep and first few districts and port were created, and Voxis as a city-state declared its sovereignty and started trade.

-The Voxis War for Independence (Year 1693 - 1699)
After they declare their sovereignty in 1693, Zevka objects as Thrysta is on their land, and Voxis fights for their independence with support from Asyria, causing a Zevkan withdrawal in 1699, and later recognition in 1701

-The Runeforged Revolutions (Year 1840-1842)
After the increased levels of sentience were achieved in Runeforged in the early 1800's, The Runeforged began to see themselves as a people deserving of the same freedoms of other humanoids. In 1840, the Runeforged decided to band together and start protesting their enslavement, wishing for the ability to gain freedom and a wage equivalent to that of any other worker. This continued on for 2 years, resulting is several violent riots and deaths among city guard, civilians, and Runeforged. In the summer of 1842, all four governments in Andefaelt held a conference in the Asyrian Capital, where it was declared that Runeforged were equal to that of any other sentient being and that they deserved equivalent rights.
