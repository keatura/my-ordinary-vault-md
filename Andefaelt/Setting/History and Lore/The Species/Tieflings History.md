Tieflings are direct offspring of Morana or their kin, and aren't well respected inside of Asyria. 

- cannot go within a close radius of large churches dedicated to Kadis and Kadis' offspring
- are physically uncomfortable while inside smaller ones and feel like they are being watched
- while they technically aren't evil by nature - their relation and the common persons' beliefs have hurt them
- related to demons
- generally viewed poorly outside of Zevka, Iyamari is distrustful and Asyria is hateful.
