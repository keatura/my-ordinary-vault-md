The previous inhabitants of Andefaelt were an incredibly powerful and magical civilization. They spanned the entire world, united in one goal - the war with the Fey. 

During this war they created a series of weapons forged out of fey blood, and gave those weapons to their most powerful leaders and fighters. These weapons amplified those chosen for them by incredible margins, allowing them to achieve superhuman feats and defeat the Fey with their own blood and essence.

One downside. 
The Feywild was important to the stability of the world.

This nation was oblivious to this fact, though. They fought hundreds and thousands of battles or century and millennia - all for one pivotal day, when they confronted the Council of Four - the rulers of the Feywild. When the Feyblood Warriors clashed with the Archfey, the world cracked and sundered open, causing destruction and calamity for everyone, fey and mortal alike.

After this battle, and the following apocalypse. the only things left were the recovering spirits of the Archfey, forming and shifting into something new. This created the current pantheon of Andefaelt, with each Archfey creating one of the main four gods. 

As well, the Feyblood weapons were scattered in ruins around Andefaelt, unbeknownst to the inhabitants and the gods, and hid themselves away for millennia.
