# General Geography and Climate

The Geography of Andefaelt is split into four major regions.

#### The Highlands

Located at a much higher elevation than the rest of the islands, the northern area of Andefaelt is comprised of lots of tundra surrounded by hills and evergreen forests. The summer months are short and wet, then everything freezes over from fall to spring. The Highlands are also much deeper islands than other places, which contributes to the altitude. Most islands have extremely noticeable sidewall, making them look almost like floating pillars. The Northern Pillar quite contrarily billows flame out from it's sides, like a second sun.

The climate is very dry year-round, with little water being added to the area, but little lost. Snow caps melt into rain in the short and hot summer months, and then repeat.

#### The Rainforest

Surrounding Ederna and spreading out a bit to the west, most of the center of Andefaelt is a temperate rainforest. The mountains can get up to several thousand feet tall, but the biggest feature is the area surrounding the Western Pillar, covered in moss and vines and surrounded by rainclouds and mists.

The winter months are still harsh, but the worst of it is relatively short. Most of the year is cool and humid. 

#### The Plains

The Plains are large, sweeping swaths of landing covered in tall grass and small rock formations that cause the wind to howl. The plains lack any extreme terrain formations, and have the most vast swaths of land in Andefaelt. The one downside is the lack of the major resource deposits of the mountains, and the depths of the Highlands. The Eastern Pillar is almost like a flute, with pipes going through it that make whistles and chimes as the high winds surrounding it blow across the plains.

#### The Mountains

To the south are the Mountains, the most extreme of all of the land 

# The Asyrian Empire
Colors I think of: light gold, white, red, and the saturated greens of rainforest
Things that give off dominance, authority, and outward appearance

The Asyrian Empire is a highly religious theocratic empire, ruled by a God-king - a bloodline said to be directly descended from Kadis. They have an incredibly strong military and navy, and their Church conducts it's own militarized wing of Clerics and Templars. Formerly consisting of several city states before they were unified by King Fariah Camillus, the serving king of the period.

Due to their history and nature, Asyria has many conflicts with other nations 

# Iyamari
Colors I think of: reds, oranges, cyan, and the whites and browns and light blues of tundra
Things that give off tradition, community, and resilience

Iyamari resides mostly within the plains of Andefaelt, spreading slightly into the Highlands in the North.
