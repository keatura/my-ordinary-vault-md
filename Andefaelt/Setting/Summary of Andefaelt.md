# General Geography and Climate

The Geography of Andefaelt is split into four major regions.

#### The Highlands

Located at a much higher elevation than the rest of the islands, the northern area of Andefaelt is comprised of lots of tundra surrounded by hills and evergreen forests. The summer months are short and wet, then everything freezes over from fall to spring. The Highlands are also much deeper islands than other places, which contributes to the altitude. Most islands have extremely noticeable sidewall, making them look almost like floating pillars. The Northern Pillar quite contrarily billows flame out from it's sides, like a second sun.

The climate is very dry year-round, with little water being added to the area, but little lost. Snow caps melt into rain in the short and hot summer months, and then repeat.

#### The Rainforest

Surrounding Ederna and spreading out a bit to the west, most of the center of Andefaelt is a temperate rainforest. The mountains can get up to several thousand feet tall, but the biggest feature is the area surrounding the Western Pillar, covered in moss and vines and surrounded by rainclouds and mists.

The winter months are still harsh, but the worst of it is relatively short. Most of the year is cool and humid. 

#### The Plains

The Plains are large, sweeping swaths of landing covered in tall grass and small rock formations that cause the wind to howl. The plains lack any extreme terrain formations, and have the most vast swaths of land in Andefaelt. The one downside is the lack of the major resource deposits of the mountains, and the depths of the Highlands. The Eastern Pillar is almost like a flute, with pipes going through it that make whistles and chimes as the high winds surrounding it blow across the plains.

The climate in the plains is evenly mixed, the strong winds beating back the smaller rainclouds from Ederna. When it is dry, its dry for a while, and when it rains, it generally rains for a few days before it dies down. The plains do get snow but due to their lower precipitations they dont experience crazy amounts. It gets hot in the summers and has the second-warmest winters.

#### The Southern Mountains

To the south are the Mountains, the most extreme of all of the land formations in Andefaelt, it is a broad scheme from green forested mountains around the outside, with it getting drier and more desert-like as you head inwards. There is three "regions" of the Southern Mountains. The outer mountains are tall with sheer cliffs and forests everywhere. The middle mountains fade into grassy valleys similar to the plains with layered orange rocky mountains shooting violently up, and at the very furthest, sandy formations of vibrant colors, reds and oranges and blue and browns. The Southern Pillar is made out of these same oxidized rocks and comes out of the top of the tallest mountain in Andefaelt, making it the only Pillar that is connected to land.

The climate of the mountains varies on how far you go in. The outer ring is temperate, similar to the other regions its adjacent to, but as you go in it turns into dry plains and even desert. There is also exponentially less rain as you pass the first spans of mountains. Due to the area between islands, you may find inner islands with a mix of both plains and forested area.

# The Asyrian Empire
Colors I think of: light gold, white, red, silver, and the saturated greens of rainforest
Things that give off dominance, authority, and outward appearance

The Asyrian Empire resides in the western rainforest, and is a highly religious theocratic empire, ruled by a God-king - a bloodline said to be directly descended from Kadis. They have an incredibly strong military and navy, and their Church conducts it's own militarized wing of Clerics and Templars. Formerly consisting of several city states before they were unified by King Fariah Camillus, the serving king of the period.

Asyria Follows Kadis primarily in their worship, though they do worship the entire pantheon, as they are all descended from Kadis. So while everyone does give prayers to Kadis, there are smaller churches and sub-chapters of religious organizations dedicated to the other gods as well.
