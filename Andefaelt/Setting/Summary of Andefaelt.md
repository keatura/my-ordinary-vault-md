# The Asyrian Empire
Colors I think of: light gold, white, red.
Things that give off dominance, authority, and outward appearance

The Asyrian Empire is a highly religious theocratic empire, ruled by a God-king - a bloodline said to be directly descended from Kadis. They have an incredibly strong military, and their Church conducts it's own militarized wing of Clerics and Templars 

# Iyamari
Colors I think of: reds, oranges, cyan, and the whites and browns and light blues of tundra
Things that give off tradition, community, and resilience

Iyamari resides mostly within the plains of Andefaelt, spreading slightly into the Highlands in the North.
