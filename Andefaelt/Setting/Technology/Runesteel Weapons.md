 Runesteel is also imbued into swords to cause new effects and bring melee weaponry into contest with guns. Guns still do not come with any major runesteel enchantments due to how volatile the metal is, it could cause very adverse effects on discharge.

Runesteel weapons work by routing cabling through the handle and hilt of the weapon to the contact points of the blade or head of the weapon. These cables then connect Runesteel capacitors, generally placed in a convenient spot on the hand, maybe embedded flush in, or somewhere similar. These capacitors by nature are disposable, and not easily rechargeable. Luckily, they are cheap and accessible, as most runesteel is in modern times. Another upside to runesteel weapons, is that the control module for the runesteel effect can be swapped out (1 bonus action) with another effect if desired. "reloading" a capacitor is also a bonus action.

If an effect from a runesteel weapon requires a target to make a save against the effect, the DC is equal to **10+mod+PB(if applicable)+weapon enchantment**. When determining the dice rolled for an effect you roll the amount of dice, multiplied by your weapon enchantment +1 (for example, if something is 2xd8, it starts at 2d8, then a +1 weapon is 4d8, +2 weapon is 6d8, etc.) You can expend charges on one effect per turn. The amount of charges a weapon has per Capacitor is equal to 2 + weapon enchantment.


some effect examples go as follows; if you have an idea for something, ask the DM and they will figure something out.
