While classified under the umbrella of "mechanized suits", powered armor is mostly seen in military use outside of exo-skeletons. Powered armor suits have a generator similar to those found in Runeforged. 

- While wearing powered armor, you count as one size larger for determining the weight you can carry, push, drag, or lift.
- You have a Strength score equal to the listed score on the armor, unless your Strength score is higher.
- You have a maximum Dexterity equal to the listed score.
- Your speed is equal to that listed on the armor
- Your Unarmed Strike Attacks deal damage equal to that listed on the armor.
- Heavy Powered Armor may wield normal weapons with the Two-Handed property (not weapons under the Heavy list) with one hand.

Powered Armor does require fuel to function. The Fuel Consumption depends on the class of armor, and Exotic armor shares its fuel consumption with either light or heavy armor.

Light Powered Armor lasts 7 days on 5gp of Diesel Fuel.
Heavy Powered Armor lasts 7 days on 15gp of Diesel Fuel
Battery Powered suits last 2 hours, and can charge their battery with 1 day's worth of fuel expended from their generator.

Due to their mechanical nature, Powered Armor can be Critically Damaged in a similar way to 'Jacks and 'Mechs. A Powered Armor suit takes Critical Damage when it:
- Is Critically Hit with an attack.
- Suffers an amount of damage equal to double it's armor class in one attack.
- Is subject to an effect or situation that could cause critical damage or warrant a malfunction, as determined by the DM.
When Powered Armor suffers a critical hit, roll on the Critical Damage Chart to see the effect.

Light powered armor is generally fitted to a user, featuring a suit of armor or no armor at all, that then firmly clips into an exposed exo-skeleton. Exo-skeletons are commonly used for heavy lifting in physical labor trades, and militaries use the armored variants for shock troops that are much more inexpensive than Jacks.

Heavy powered armor is a size up, with longer lower leg sections and forearm sections to allow the suit to reach heights of up to 7 or 8 feet tall. They also feature extremely heavy armor sections that give the wearer Resistance to non-magical Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage.
