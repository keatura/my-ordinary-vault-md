While classified under the umbrella of "mechanized suits", powered armor is mostly seen in military use outside of exo-skeletons. Powered armor suits have a generator similar to those found in Runeforged. 

- While wearing powered armor, you count as one size larger for determining the weight you can carry, push, drag, or lift.
- You have a Strength score equal to the listed score on the armor, unless your Strength score is higher.
- You have a maximum Dexterity equal to the listed score.
- Your speed is equal to that listed on the armor
- Your Unarmed Strike Attacks deal damage equal to that listed on the armor.
- Heavy Powered Armor may wield normal weapons with the Two-Handed property (not weapons under the Heavy list) with one hand.

Powered Armor does require fuel to function. The Fuel Consumption depends on the class of armor, and Exotic armor shares its fuel consumption with either light or heavy armor.

Light Powered Armor lasts 7 days on 5gp of Diesel Fuel.
Heavy Powered Armor lasts 7 days on 15gp of Diesel Fuel
Battery Powered suits last 2 hours, and can charge their battery with 1 day's worth of fuel expended from their generator.

Due to their mechanical nature, Powered Armor can be Critically Damaged in a similar way to 'Jacks and 'Mechs. A Powered Armor suit takes Critical Damage when it:
- Is Critically Hit with an attack.
- Suffers an amount of damage equal to double it's armor class in one attack.
- Is subject to an effect or situation that could cause critical damage or warrant a malfunction, as determined by the DM.
When Powered Armor suffers a critical hit, roll on the Critical Damage Chart to see the effect.

| 3   | **Operator Rattled.** The shot collides with the armor forcefully and sends intense vibrations through the suit. You cannot take reactions until the end of your next turn.                                                                                   | ---                                                                                                          |
| 4   | **Arm Damaged.** One of the Armor's arms is crippled as a result. Roll a d6 (1-3 left, 4-6 right). Until the damage is repaired, you have disadvantage on attack rolls made with the damaged arm.                                                             | DC 10 Intelligence.

Light powered armor is generally fitted to a user, featuring a suit of armor or no armor at all, that then firmly clips into an exposed exo-skeleton. Exo-skeletons are commonly used for heavy lifting in physical labor trades, and militaries use the armored variants for shock troops that are much more inexpensive than Jacks.

Heavy powered armor is a size up, with longer lower leg sections and forearm sections to allow the suit to reach heights of up to 7 or 8 feet tall. They also feature extremely heavy armor sections that give the wearer Resistance to non-magical Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage. Heavy powered armor also has flat damage reduction to all physical damage dealt to the suit. The number is equal to the Pilot's Proficiency Bonus.

Exotic powered armor follows the general rules for its class of Powered Armor (either light or heavy), but they also come with special rules and require special training.

**Templar's Armor.** Templar Armor is designed to work with the Asyrian Church's transport ships, and have runesteel shock absorbers built into their legs, allowing them to ignore fall damage. Templar Armor has a built-in Gasmask in the helmet.

**Shocktroops' Exo.** The Iyamarian Aerial Cavalry Corps utilizes light, fast exo-skeleton armors to facilitate quick and powerful assaults and execute flanking maneuvers efficiently. This Armor has a built-in Gasmask in the helmet, and come with a deployable knife built into the arms for quick reaction and CQB. They also have power-regulation systems that allow them to enter a state of "silent running", allowing the suit to move nearly silently apart from the noise of the mechanics, for up to an hour. After this hour, the suit must be given at least 2 hours of rest to purge itself before it is safe to do so again.
