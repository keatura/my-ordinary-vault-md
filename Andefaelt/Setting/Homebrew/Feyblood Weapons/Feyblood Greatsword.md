*King Symus' personal Greatsword, a finely crafted magical sword, with a blade forged of dragon scales, that feeds off of the users power. It bears a striking resemblance to the legendary weapon, Grymblade, though resembles a sword instead of a scythe.*

###### Weapon (Greatsword), Legendary, (requires attunement)

While attuned to the Drakeblood Greatsword you gain the following benefits:

**Charges**
- This weapon has a number of charges equal to the users Paladin level.
- When you reduce an enemy to 0 HP, you regain a number of charges equal to your proficiency bonus, but not exceeding the max  charges of your weapon.

1. When you hit an enemy with less than their max HP, you may spend a charge to gain an amount of temp HP equal to your paladin level plus your charisma modifier, until the end of combat.
  
While attuned to the Drakeblood Greatsword, you feel motivated to feed it. When you are in combat, and not within melee range of an enemy creature, you must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or move up to your speed immediately towards the closest enemy as a reaction. You can willingly fail this check. While out of combat, being attuned to this weapon causes you to feel subconsciously elated at the sight of death and blood, similar to an intrusive thought.
