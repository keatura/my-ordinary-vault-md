###### Weapon (Dagger), Legendary, (requires attunement)

When you attune to this weapon, its power floods your conscious and affects your psyche. When you draw the weapon you become:
- Extremely egotistical and self-centered.
- You feel encouraged to give yourself to the dagger, and share control of your body with it.
- Pathologically attached to the dagger, and unwilling to let go or even banish it to the pocket dimension. (DC 15 Charisma save to banish it, can benefit from the Help Action.)

If you shunt it to it's pocket dimension, it's influence becomes lesser, only being able to speak to you in short sentences and the attuned individual being free from its influence on their psyche.

*While attuned to the Feyblood Dagger you gain the following benefits:*

- You are proficient with this weapon and gain a +2 to attack and damage rolls.

- This weapon's damage die is a d8 instead of a d4.

- Instead of the normal ranged attack you make with this weapons Thrown property, you point the dagger at a creature within 60 feet of you, summoning a spectral version of the weapon from somewhere near you. Make a Ranged Weapon Attack against the target, dealing 1d6 plus your dexterity on a hit.

*If you listen to the weapon and give partial control of yourself to it, you gain the following features:*

Your eyes and veins start to glow a faint sickly yellow glow while you are holding the weapon. The dagger also drips ethereal fluid of the same sickly yellow glow, that evaporates soon after it drips off the blade. 

- Your Weapon Attacks deal an extra 2d6 Radiant damage.

- You can cast the Booming Blade and Green-Flame Blade cantrips at will. They can target any creature within 60 feet of you, and scale their damage with your level.

- You can summon and banish the dagger to it's pocket dimension at will.

- You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid being charmed or frightened that dont come from the dagger.

*If you give yourself fully to the Dagger, you become an NPC under the DM's control. This control may be possible to remove, but it requires a Remove Curse spell cast at a minimum of 5th level.*
