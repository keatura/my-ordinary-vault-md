*The Sword of Temporal Justice is an artifact created by Kaine's followers thousands of years ago. It was created with the guidance of Kaine himself, as a gift for his angel, Sidriel. This blade was used throughout the years to defeat those who sought to destroy Kaine's church and punish powerful evils.*

###### Weapon (Longsword), Artifact (requires attunement)

The Sword of Temporal Justice is an ancient bastard sword flowing with divine energy. The attuned user gains a +3 to attack and damage rolls made with it. The sword deals and extra 2d10 radiant damage to evil creatures and also has the *finesse* property. In order to attune to this weapon, the user must be a follower of Kaine, and pray to Him at least one a day.

When this weapon is wielded by an attuned user, that user gains the Judgement class feature from Inquisitor, but can only inflict the *Destruction* Judgement. If the user is an Inquisitor, they gain an extra use of their Judgement feature.

Also, as an action, the user of this sword may raise their sword to the sky, and give a prayer to Kaine for support in their battle. After they do this, the user and any allies of their choosing within 30ft gain 2d8 temporary hit points, and any hostile creature takes 2d8 radiant damage.
