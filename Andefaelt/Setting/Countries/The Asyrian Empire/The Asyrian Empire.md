The Asyrian Empire is the most military power of the four nations. They control much of the land surround Ederna, and worship the Storm as an idol of the gods. The population consists primarily of Humans and Ukucha, beings of chaotic energy thought be children of the Storm itself. The locations of the Empire around the Storm means they have comfortable lives and never suffer droughts, though rain is common, especially during the raining season where rain is consistent at least three or four times a week. The people of Asyria believe that they are closer to the gods than every other nation, and are a very religious nation, run by a King and Queen, who have political and religious rule over the country.

Separate from the Asyrian Military, 

### The Clerics

- sub-chapters with different types
- healers
- priests
- envoys
- While they all fulfill different purposes, and aren't primarily combatants like the Templars 

### The Templars

- big suits of powered armor
- halberd guns
- "The Right Arm of the Church"
- VERY religious, fairly isolated from the outside world
- Their armor is basically extremely heavy and thick runesteel plate with the edge of tomorrow exoskeleton and a gas mask built into the helmet
- two sub-chapters: the Templars with powered armor are the forefront, while the Paladins are trainees who are proving themselves worthy of becoming a Templar. a senior Templar is generally entrusted to oversee a group of Paladins who fulfill missions for the Templar and the Church, and also act as his Squires, learning how to repair and maintain the powered armor of the Templars.
