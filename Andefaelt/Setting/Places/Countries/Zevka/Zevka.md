## Overview

Zevka is the most open of all the major nations, prioritizing individual achievement and valuing ones contribution to the nation. Living in the Highlands, a group of islands at an abnormally high altitude, leaving less oxygen and colder temperatures than most other lands have bred a nation of strong, motivated peoples. Zevka has a wide variety of people in it, and is where many of the less accepted races have come to find their place. Tyrfolk, Dragonborn, and Loxodon make up a large amount of the non-human population. Zevka's lands are very hostile, and while not containing the dangerous beasts of Iyamari, the climate proves harsh enough for its inhabitants. While Zevka culture does value individual achievement, it expects its citizens to look out for their family, friends, and neighbors. Civil infighting cannot be allowed to happen, and one should always provide warm food and a place at their fire if they are in need.

### Population

The top 5 highest populations in Zevka are:
1. Humans
2. Ukucha
3. Dragonborn
4. Tyrfolk
5. Loxodon

Other races live in Zevka as well, but many prefer to stay in their homelands, and thus the populations for more humanoid races such as elves and dwarves number very low inside of Zevka's borders.

There are no major issues between races inside of Zevka. Due to the countries values, its citizens do not care about ones appearance, rather caring about their ability to sustain themselves and provide for their community. Any person who makes their name known through great deeds of any kind, whether that be military, community, or individual accomplishment.

### Geography

Zevka's territory encompasses all of the Highlands. This gives them quite a substantial amount of land, but due to these islands being old, they are not as resource rich as the Islands many newer countries inhabit. The Highlands are an archipelago of islands to the north of Ederna, several thousand feet higher than most other inhabited islands. Due to their altitude, air is thin and temperatures cold. The people of Zevka are adapted to this though, and apart from a few islands lower altitude for farming Zevkan residents are hardened by the harsh climate.
