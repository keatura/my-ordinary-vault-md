Iyamari is to the southeast of Ederna, and is the homeland of Elves. also called the Great Plains, the southeast of Andefaelt where the Iyamari live is a massive span of anywhere between almost desert-like plains and forested islands. The Iyamari are a more scattered people, with many islands lacking major cities and being made up of hundreds of villages that intertwine together. Individual community is important in Iyamari with individual villages functioning as separate societies, with interlocking trade, feuds, and sometimes even skirmishes. There is a Capital city and government of Iyamari, but it mainly serves as a mediating force for the villages, and makes sure any skirmishes do not cause civil war in the country.
