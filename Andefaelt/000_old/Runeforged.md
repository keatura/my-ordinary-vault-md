Runeforged are a race of sentient automatons created to intelligently serve a master who orders one to be made for them. Through many different means, a Runeforged may gain their freedom and live normally among society. Devised by Dwarven engineers in the year 1453, Runeforged traditionally were powered by steam boilers and were basically just smaller version of what we now recognize as Laborjacks. As the invention of diesel power and advances in cortex technology has advanced, increased the intellectual capacity of a Runeforged, they began to start declaring themselves as an independent race to the other humanoid species living. After a revolution in the years 1840 - 1842, Runeforged agreed to terms to be paid for their servitude and willingly quit providing their services to a master, and also allowing them to start making their way into other trades, like working ports (which they are very renowned in for their stamina due to being automatons), and also are very popular to be hired into ship crews. 

**Ability Score Increase**
Your constitution score increased by two and another one of your stats of your choice is increased by 2. Your dexterity decreases by 1.

**Age**
A Runeforged' body typically lasts around 60 years before needing major repairs. due to real sentience in Runeforged' cortexes only being a more recent development, it is unsure how long a cortex lasts before its ability to retain memories and emotions fades.

**Alignment**
Runeforged are naturally inclined to be Neutral, but may take up personality traits of those around them as they age.

**Size**
A Runeforged is generally between five and a half feet and 7 feet tall, depending on the manufacturer and year of creation. Your size is medium.

**Constructed Resilience**
You were created to have remarkable fortitude, represented by the following benefits:

- You donâ€™t need to eat, drink, or breathe.
- You are immune to disease.
- You don't need to sleep, and magic can't put you to sleep.

**Fuel Dependent**
As a mechanical being, you do not need to eat or sleep. Although, you start to run out of fuel after roughly 7 days. You can refill by fueling yourself with 1gp worth of diesel, which can be bought in cans and carried. When you run out of fuel, you gain 1 level of exhaustion per hour, until you reach 5 levels where you shut off and become dormant until someone refills your tank. After you are refilled, you return back to normal with no levels of exhaustion.

**Idle**
When a Runeforged has the opportunity to long rest, instead of staying awake they may choose to enter a low-function state of idling. During this period, they regain 1 day's worth of fuel, but count as a completely inert object during this time, only woken up earlier if a companion forces them to for any reason. 

**Integrated Protection**
Your body has built-in defensive layers, which can be enhanced with armor.
- You gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class.
- You can don only armor with which you have proficiency. To don armor, you must incorporate it into your body over the course of 1 hour, during which you must remain in contact with the armor. To doff armor, you must spend 1 hour removing it. You can rest while donning or doffing armor in this way.
- While you live, your armor can't be removed from your body against your will.
