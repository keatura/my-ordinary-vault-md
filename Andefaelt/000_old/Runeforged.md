Runeforged are a race of sentient automatons created to intelligently serve a master who orders one to be made for them. Through many different means, a Runeforged may gain their freedom and live normally among society. Devised by Dwarven engineers in the year 1453, Runeforged traditionally were powered by steam boilers and were basically just smaller version of what we now recognize as Laborjacks. As the invention of diesel power and advances in cortex technology has advanced, increased the intellectual capacity of a Runeforged, they began to start declaring themselves as an independent race to the other humanoid species living. After a revolution in the years 1823 - 1842, Runeforged agreed to terms to be paid for their servitude and willingly quit providing their services to a master, and also allowing them to start making their way into other trades, like working ports (which they are very renowned in for their stamina due to being automatons), and also are very popular to be hired into ship crews. 

**Age**
A Runeforged' body typically lasts around 60 years before needing major repairs. due to real sentience in Runeforged' cortexes only being a more recent development, it is unsure how long a cortex lasts before its ability to retain memories and emotions fades.

**Alignment**
Runeforged are naturally inclined to be Neutral, but may take up personality traits of those around them as they age.

**Speed**
Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

**Constructed Resilience**
You were created to have remarkable fortitude, represented by the following benefits:
- You have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and you have resistance to poison damage.
- You don’t need to eat, or drink.
- You are immune to disease.
- You don't need to sleep, and magic can't put you to sleep.

**Fuel Dependent**
As a mechanical being, you do not need to eat or sleep. Although, you start to run out of fuel after roughly 7 days. You can refill by fueling yourself with 1gp worth of diesel, which refills 1 day of fuel. This fuel can be bought in cans and carried. When you run out of fuel, you gain 1 level of exhaustion per minute, until you reach 5 levels where you shut off and become dormant until someone refills your tank. After you are refilled, you return back to normal with no levels of exhaustion.

**Power Off**
When a Runeforged has the opportunity to long rest, instead of staying awake they may choose to power off. During this period, they do not spend the days fuel, and passively recharge instead. When they choose this, they count as a completely inert object during this time, only woken up earlier if a companion forces them to for any reason. If they are interrupted during this period, the days worth of fuel is still spent.

**Languages**
You can read and write Common.

##### Notes

- Runeforged can "breathe" underwater due to a air tank buffer incase they are submerged, thus following the normal 5e rules for holding your breath.
- They ingest fuel by drinking it.
- "Hygiene" for a Runeforged consists of gently scraping off surface rust and making sure their joints are well greased. Every Runeforged carries a basic care kit with things such as high grit sandpaper and steel brushes, and grease is readily available.
