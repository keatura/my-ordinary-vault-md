Runeforged are a Species of sentient automatons created to intelligently serve a master who orders one to be made for them. Through many different means, a Runeforged may gain their freedom and live normally among society. Devised by Dwarven engineers in the year 1453, Runeforged traditionally were powered by steam boilers and were basically just smaller version of what we now recognize as Laborjacks. As the invention of diesel power and advances in cortex technology has advanced, increased the intellectual capacity of a Runeforged, they began to start declaring themselves as an independent species to the other humanoid species living. After a revolution in the years 1823 - 1842, Runeforged succeeded in cementing their independence, being recognized as a species and earning their places in society. This allowed them to start making their way into trades, like working ports, which they are highly valued, and are also very popular to be hired into ship crews. Though not all Runeforged work heavy labor trades, many, especially of the lighter models, find themselves working in bars, restaurants, and other work that allows them to showcase their incredible stamina.

Their nature means that Runeforged do not have a concept of "gender" the same way that other species do. While the model, manufacturer, and general deviance may change the voice of a Runeforged from one individual to another, Their focus is more on unity as a whole community, with no focus on individuals and families. It is generally accepted to refer to Runeforged as:
- They/Them
- It/Its
Though, they do accept traditional gendered pronouns as a form of closer bond to people they are close to, whether friends or coworkers.

Some Runeforged choose to not work in physical labor, finding other means of fulfillment, 

**Age**
A Runeforged' body typically lasts around 20 years before needing major repairs. due to real sentience in Runeforged' cortexes only being a more recent development, it is unsure how long a cortex lasts before its ability to retain memories and emotions fades, though regular maintenance can extend this. It is impossible to transfer memories from one cortex to another, so if a cortex is to fade, it is permanent death.

**Alignment**
Runeforged are naturally inclined to be Lawful, but may take up personality traits of those around them as they age.

**Speed**
Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

**Constructed Resilience**
You were created to have remarkable fortitude, represented by the following benefits:
- You have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and you have resistance to poison damage.
- You don’t need to eat or drink.
- You are immune to disease.
- You don't need to sleep, and magic can't put you to sleep.

**Fuel Dependent**
As a mechanical being, you do not need to eat or sleep. Although, you start to run out of fuel after roughly 7 days. You can refill by fueling yourself with 1gp worth of diesel, which refills 1 day of fuel. This fuel can be bought in cans and carried. When you run out of fuel, you gain 1 level of exhaustion per minute, until you reach 5 levels where you shut off and become dormant until someone refills your tank. After you are refilled, you return back to normal with no levels of exhaustion.

**Power Off**
When a Runeforged has the opportunity to long rest, instead of staying awake they may choose to power off. During this period, they do not spend the days fuel, and passively recharge instead. When they choose this, they count as a completely inert object during this time, only woken up earlier if a companion forces them to for any reason. If they are interrupted during this period, the days worth of fuel is still spent.

##### Notes

- Runeforged can "breathe" underwater due to a air tank buffer incase they are submerged, thus following the normal 5e rules for holding your breath.
- They ingest fuel by drinking it.
- "Hygiene" for a Runeforged consists of gently scraping off surface rust and making sure their joints are well greased. Every Runeforged carries a basic care kit with things such as high grit sandpaper and steel brushes, and grease is readily available.
- Runeforged have a magical converter as a part of their damage control system, which can convert the source energy from healing magic into power for the built-in repair system on a Runeforged, speeding up the process.
- Due to their advanced nature, acquiring a new body or repairing a severely damaged one in **incredibly expensive**.
