The realm of Andefaelt is varied in its geography, featuring areas of all climates. First of all, Northward, you have the Highlands, where Zevka and its residents reside. The Highlands are exactly as they sound, islands many thousands of feet higher than their peers. This creates a mean climate that has hardened the creatures that reside within. Then, to the southeast you have the Great Plains, a varied area of forest, desert, and grassland combined to create a temperate zone. To the west is a stony mountainous area when Onyxia takes its hold. Abundant with stone and metal, Onyxia is no stranger to material wealth. Though this may seem fortunate, the lack of available ground space means much time is spent digging and building platforms to create space for the populace to live. Around the center of the Storm is a rainforest encircling all of the closest islands, due to the rainy weather from Ederna, this area is abundant with food and animals.
