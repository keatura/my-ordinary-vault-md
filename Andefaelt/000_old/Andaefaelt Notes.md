Ideas
The races of Thea come from Heoma (human) literature and ideas
The focal point of all of the islands is a giant storm, constantly raging with hundred plus mile and hour winds and dark black clouds and lightning
The the Eye of the World (the center) is unknown to the people of Thea (thtaya), and is blocked by thousands of square miles of Ederna (E-daere-na), the Everlasting Storm
The world is a fractured version of Pangea, and the center of the storm contains a machine from the Heoma that caused a rupture in the reality of the world, causing the creation of Relentium, a crystal with abnormal gravity defying properties and fractured the ground, leaving a layer of white, fluffy clouds flowing out from the bottom of Ederna and obscuring whatever may lie beneath
This machine is a collective consciousness of all of humanity's knowledge and stories, and all of the stories and culture humanity will ever have, overflowing and creating an almost sub-dimension of whatever remains of the universe of what the machine thinks, although the machine is unthinking, is the universe.
When in the presence of The Machine, anyone can hear 1979 by the Smashing Pumpkins playing at a comfortable volume, although the language spoken is unknown to anyone who hears.
If someone falls off the island, they are taken to Time. Time is the fabric of reality encased and blocked out by the gentle clouds of Ederna. When someone arrives in time, they find themselves surrounded by the dark black clouds of the Eye of the World with wind, although gentle but firm, guiding them in a specific direction. Leading directly to the Center, a clear bright green grassy clearing, with the Machine in the center. Gently humming. Of course, none of this is known, but it is recognised, unwillingly and subconsciously by every single person, only brought to the forefront of your mind when you enter Time, and forgotten when you leave.
If the party finds the machine and replaces the record for a different one, it shuffles the current reality to a new one.
