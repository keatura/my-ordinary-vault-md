The Coalpowders (Black, Red, Orange) Are the wealthiest of the 3 major gangs. They have connections outside of Voxis, and use these connections to route in contraband such as Coral and also weapons and even food and water. This causes the Coalpowders to have constant skirmishes with not just the other big two, but also any wannabe big shot who feels confident enough to try and raid a Coalpowder storage depot. The Coalpowders have staked territory mostly around the western port, controlling a lot more of the populated area of the West Port. They generally stay out of traders business, to keep merchant flow high and to keep their imports coming in unnoticed. The Coalpowders leader is a Woman named Rora Wills, who is spontaneous, chaotic, and not a natural leader. This means that without their money the Coalpowders are weak and their command structure is fragile.
