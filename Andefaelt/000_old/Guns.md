Guns are a common sight in Andefaelt. Removable magazines are a newer invention, and do not exist outside of military rifles. Most civilian firearms are breech loaded rifles, revolvers, or have an internal magazine. Black powder weapons are antiques and are no longer used. double barrel and tube fed shotguns are available to civilians, with the latter being much more expensive to purchase.

Weapon culture in Andefaelt is very open. It is common to see people walk on the streets of cities like Voxis carrying weapons such as swords and guns. Despite the open carrying of weapons, it is generally frowned upon to resort to a weapon in a conflict with another person. Weapons are commonly used as a status symbol, to show off your wealth with a master craftsman's work. If a fight is going to be had, most prefer to resolve it with their fists, and death is to be avoided. 

Ranged weapons use DEX, and larger weapons will require minimum strength scores to shoot accurately. If a person has below the minimum strength score required to wield the weapon, they have disadvantage on attack rolls and cannot fire more than one shot per turn. Weapons with the muzzle loaded property also cannot be fired more than once per turn. Reloading a weapon takes a full action, unless someone has the [Crossbow Master](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/feat:crossbow-expert) feat, which when taken, applies to either firearms, or crossbows (the user decides when they take the feat).

Ammo is 1gp/5 rounds, and when you buy it you decide what weapon it is for. That ammo only works for that weapon, or other weapons that are the exact same. (common revolver ammo works with other common revolver ammo, etc)

### Special Rules

**Reload.** A weapon with the reload property must take a full action to a firearm when the ammo capacity stated in parenthesis is consumed unless they have a feature that states otherwise. For example, after a character using a revolver expends all 5 shots of the firearm, they must take a Bonus Action to reload the weapon.

**Slow Shooting.** A firearm with the slow shooting feature can only be fired once per turn, bypassing any feature that says otherwise.

**Buckshot.** when a firearm with the buckshot feature makes a weapon attack against a creature, the player may decide to forego the standard weapon range and replace the shot with a 30ft cone. Creatures within this cone must make a dexterity saving throw equal to 10 + your to-hit modifier (dex + proficiency + weapon enchantment). On a successful save, the enemy takes half damage.

**Rapid Fire.** A rapid fire weapon has an exceptional ability to make follow up shots. When a user makes a weapon attack on their turn, they make one extra attack. If the user has the Extra Attack feature, they make a second extra attack, up to 4 attacks per turn. Any extra bonus attacks gained by class features do increase this as well. For example, at level 5 a Fighter may make up to 4 attacks per turn, the 4th requiring their Bonus Action. Then, at 11th level, the Fighter would be able to make 6 attacks per turn.

**Anti-Materiel.** The large caliber of this weapon allows for it to punch through walls and armor. When making an attack with an Anti-Materiel weapon, it ignores all 1/2 and 3/4 cover, and when targeting a Construct, it automatically critically hits.

**Bayonet.** When this weapon is mounted on the end of a two-handed rifle, the user may forfeit their ranged attack to make a melee weapon attack against a creature, that deals 1d6 piercing damage. This damage is increased by 1d6 for every 10 feet the creature has moved this turn, up to a maximum 5d6.

### Exotic Weapons
Exotic Weapons are very unique weaponry that are very rare. These weapons require Martial Weapon Proficiency, and cannot be chosen as starting equipment.

**Supercharged Weapons.** The Runesteel Supercharger present on this weapon allows for the expenditure of a capacitor charge to boost the muzzle velocity of the large caliber round fired by this weapon, boosting the damage significantly. Reloading the weapon after firing it supercharged requires replacing the capacitor and changing out the barrel of the rifle too, which takes 1 minute when performed by someone proficient with the weapon. When this rifle makes its supercharged attack against a construct, such as a building or 'Jack, the attack automatically critical hits. This attack also counts as a 5-foot-wide line equal to the weapons range, ignoring all cover, instead of a targeted attack, and everything in the line takes full damage.

**Runesteel.** A runesteel firearm is an experimental piece of tech, and unreliable. When loaded with a runesteel capacitor, they may make attacks affected by runesteel effects, but every attack made using a charge from the runesteel capacitor heats up the barrel and internals of the gun, giving you a a level of **overheat**, giving you a -1 per stack for 1 hour each, decreasing by 1 per hour. When your to-hit modifier reaches -5 or lower, the gun overheats and you have to spend at least 1 hour and 50gp (100gp for two handed) of work and materials to repair the gun, before it can be used again.

**Suppressed Pistol.** This weapon is an integrally suppressed pistol, firing subsonic ammunition. Due to this, it's ammo is rare and costs twice as much as regular ammo. As well, when this weapon is fired, it is as silent as a bow, meaning it cannot be heard outside of 15ft.

**Grenade Launcher.** This weapon fires large, low velocity explosive projectiles. Due to this, it's ammo is rare and costs 3x as much as normal. When this weapon can be aimed at a specific square, instead of a targeted Creature. It's range is a flat 60 feet, and every creature within 20 feet of the point of impact must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 damage, or half as much on a failed save.

### Heavy Weapons
These weapons are intended for use in emplacements, people in power armor and small warjacks. Due to their large size and huge weight, they are completely impractical for use by those not in powered armor. Someone may equip one of these weapons, but every weapon counts as having the Two-Handed property, and they may not use it to make an attack without receiving the Help action from someone else under the specific purpose of using the weapon. This Help action does not provide Advantage.

The Ammo costs for all Heavy Weapons are doubled.

**Machine Gun.** 
- This Weapon cannot be fired unless it is being held by a Creature that:
	- Is Large
	- Has the Powerful Build Feature
	- Is Prone
	- Is in half-cover
	- Is wearing powered armor
		- **Sweeping Fire.** When the attack action is made with a Machine Gun by a creature that is proficient with this weapon, they may forfeit their action, bonus action, and movement that turn to make an attack roll with advantage. This attack roll is then applied against every creature of their choosing in a 60-foot cone. The amount of creatures targeted may not exceed the current remaining ammo in the Machine Guns magazine.
			- For example, if there was 8 creatures in this cone, and the user rolled a 17 to hit, every creature with an AC of 17 or lower would have damage rolled against them.

**Hand Cannon.**
- This weapon's ammo costs 3x as much as normal, instead of 2x.
	- **Effects.**
		- **High Explosive.** This ammunition type deals an additional 1d6 Piercing damage to the target and every Creature in a 10ft radius surrounding them.
		- **Armor Piercing.** This ammunition type counts as magical for the purpose of ignoring resistance to Piercing damage.
		- **Incendiary.** This ammunition type causes the target to take 1d6 fire damage for the next minute, or until it uses an Action to put itself out. Future hits with this ammunition type only reset the timer, they do not apply more damage.
		- **Grenade.** This ammunition type can be aimed at a specific square, instead of a targeted Creature. It changes the weapon's range to a flat 60 feet, and every creature within 20 feet of the point of impact must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 damage, or half as much on a failed save.
