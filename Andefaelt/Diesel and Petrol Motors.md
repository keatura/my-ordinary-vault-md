Diesel and petrol is a relatively new technology in Andefaelt. It was developed from a refinement process involving Relentium, that breaks the crystal down into a liquid similar to what we know as crude oil. The rest of the fuel refinement process continues as normal as it does in real life. Due to the nature of the fractional distillation of petroleum fuel, both diesel and normal petroleum gas exist, and are used.
