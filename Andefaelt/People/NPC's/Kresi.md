Kresi is a Kobold living in Voxis, and defying the expectation set by his looks and background, he is a master at navigating the undercity and knows many things that someone of his status shouldn't know. Despite his squalid appearance, which he uses to blend in among others, he has an assortment of magical items that he uses to explore the undercity for ancient Thrystan artifacts and also explore ancient temples. 

- roleplay him as sketchy on the outside
- if players choose to trust him he can appear around and help them out on dungeon diving and exploration
- he looks like a beggar with tattered clothes and a generally feeble appearance
- knows a spot
