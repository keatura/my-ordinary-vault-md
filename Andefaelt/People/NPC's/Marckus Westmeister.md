**Marckus Westmeister** is a teenage human from Kalivny. He found the Feyblood dagger while exploring in the woods, and it enraptured him, manipulating him to lead the goblins and capture the island. At heart he is just a teenage boy, but the dagger's magic is causing him to act abnormally. The only reason Marckus is as weak as he is, is because even subconsciously he is fighting back against the weapon's influence so he can go back to his parents. The dagger has been telling him that his actions will make the island a better place, that him and his family will live happily and wealthily.

The Dagger and even Marckus himself drip Holy Blight, a sickeningly yellow radiant liquid that evaporates shortly after leaving contact. Casting spells and using his dagger to attack accentuates this, as he gets weaker, this same light stars to spill from his eyes and drip from his tear ducts.
