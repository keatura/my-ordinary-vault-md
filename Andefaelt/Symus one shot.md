Zevka is winning the war under Symus' command

Symus is in his castle, confident that he does not have to worry about Asyria anymore

Kal'eve brings him out to watch the sunset over Ederna

see a massive armada of Asyrian landing ships approaching

see how Symus reacts

however the actions go, the battle starts to go in the Asyrians favor, and Symus' wife Kal'eve turns to him, and tells him to go find a spell from the keep, she will hold them off from taking the castle.

When he gets back to the keep, he finds a spell scroll, and without reading it fully he sees the words "invulnerability"

casting the spell, stone spreads across his skin, his sword falling to the ground next to him and the power drains from his body, skin shriveling and crumpling under the spell. as the stone spreads up towards his head, his vision goes black and his vision transfers for just a moment, to his wife's point of view. He watches as if he was a spectator, as if it was just a nightmare, he watches his wife and son be slaughtered by Asyrian soldiers, as they march on the castle.

cut to the current day, Symus wakes up from his seemingly endless nightmare of his wife's death replaying over, and over, and over again, to cracks slowly forming over his eyes.

he finds himself in the crypt of his castle, now crumbling, cold, and dark with his sword in perfect condition scattered on the floor next to him.

the other spell scrolls have been ruined by water and age over the years

as he gets a bearing on his surroundings, he looks down and sees the torn rags that remain of his clothes, and his now skeletal frame underneath.

limps through small mini dungeon, maybe combat? draw dungeon

make sure he gets his armor and finds cloth scraps to form his outfit before he gets out.
