The Stormkin in Andefaelt are relatives to elves that have been influenced by Ederna. They are beings of chaotic energy and share a similar place in society to the Ukucha, though a much smaller population. They are not widely accepted outside of Asyria and Zevka, due to their inherent chaotic nature. Stormkin, unlike the Ukucha though, are more inclined to be neutral like an elf, and this has led to a worse reputation generally, as the Ukucha tend to help out others which offsets their chaotic nature, Stormkin are not as inclined to do so.
