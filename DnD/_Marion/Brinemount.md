1. Yohoho - he was a vital Blasphemer when it came to the naval front of the war. Considering Velen is a single continent, this front wasn't super important, but it still affected stuff.
2. He was high enough rank to have a distinct uniform. His outfit was a long coat with blue highlights and was known for his mask he used to cover his face. It was made out of wood and had this faint grin carved on it.
3. Part of why the battle was troublesome was bc he had acquired a potent staff that granted him a deal of water magic - something that caused chaos when the Legion and Curse Hunters launched their amphibious assault
4. Can create big fish soldiers? or at least control them. First and only time they were ever seen was at Barthus.
5. Doesn't like fighting, he leaves that to his minions.
