1. Why do they do what they do

Marion is a Curse Hunter because she joined the organization when she turned 18 and has been doing it ever since. She is motivated by her belief that she is ridding the world of evil, and despite some very traumatic events has managed to stick to that belief and keep going.

2. Do they have any friends, if so how is that going for them, what are they like, who are they, how did they meet

Marion has had many friends within the organization, though a lot of them died while at the Battle of Fort Barthus, hunting Blasphemer Brinemount. There are a few core ones, who she is close with.

a. Hunter Franz, who had his face horrifically deformed and his right left permanently injured by Hunter Adok in a fit of rage while on a hunt. Franz and Marion joined the Curse Hunters around the same time and they became friends during boot camp. They spent a lot of time together after that, but after his injury, Marion returned to the field while Franz stayed back at the main branch of the Church as an assistant cook. 

b. Hunter Franklin, who is a low ranking hunter, and Marion's brother. After the Battle of Fort Barthus, Marion framed him for disobeying orders on a mission and disrespecting Selestis to keep him low ranking and safe from the horrors of war. She of course has never told him this, and is conflicted if it was the right choice, as it was very impulsive at the time as a reaction from the trauma of losing so many people hunting Brinemount.

c. Hunter Gartrerra, one of the few dwarven hunters in the Church, has spent many missions with Marion and their styles of fighting compliment each other well, with Marion covering Gartrerra with long range fire and spells while Gartrerra fights up close. Gartrerra is a hardy, friendly, and loud dwarven woman, who is not shy of sharing her achievements in battle -the great many that she has under her belt. She loves telling stories of heroism and adventure to the young children and orphans that live with the church. 

3. Past relationships? What’s the current standing on that, are they still going, are yall chill or nah, etc. If they are still going for how long, are you happy with it, how deep it go, etc.



4. Familial relationships

Marion's mom and dad are still alive, they live out on a farm in the plains. She is on good terms with them but has not seen them in roughly 7-8 years due to her service as a Curse Hunter in the Church. Her younger brother is a fellow hunter.

5. Beliefs

She believes in actions above words. Marion despises people who take less "moral" paths in lives, such as bandits and believes all undead creatures and those associated with them, such as blasphemers, must die.

6. Morals and values

Marion values relationships and commitment to those relationships a lot, even past death. She will never talk bad about a person trying their best to good after they die. 



Once a week, Marion writes the names of all of the Hunters that have died on missions with her, and writes one memory that they shared, on a piece of paper, then burns the paper. She does this to help her accept the losses she has dealt with in the field and manage the grief of loss.

7. Limits (Where’s the line, what would it take to cross it, why are the limits there)

She draws the line at pointless murder of the innocent. Though she will not let innocent people from stopping her Hunt.

8. Faith (Religion, code, stuff like that, do they follow those thingies?)

She is a committed member of the Church, and worships Selestis.

9. Valued belongings

10. Where do they live, do they like it, where would they like to live

11. What do they hate, pet peeves too



12. Does anyone hate them, do they hate anyone

Marion hates many people. 

- **The Cardinal.** The Cardinal has tormented Marion for a year now. He wants to use the church to gain power and seems to be stealing power from The Anointed. He also has some form of control over The Fiend. He is a pain in the ass and resembles everything wrong with the Church, and deserves death.
- **Brinemount.** While not a particularly famous Blasphemer with the likes of Maragathon, Selamon, and Remahaz, Brinemount has done more direct hurt to Marion than any other Blasphemer, and possibly any other enemy. After the Battle of Fort Barthus, and when almost all of Marion's friends lay dead at his hands, she has fostered an indescribable need for revenge on him. 
- **Priestess Dominica.** Dominica was a elite in the Church, who was briefly assigned to make sure the Curse Hunters would stay loyal to their mission, but managed this job poorly. She directly led to Adok and his massacres.
- **Adok the Garroter.** A particularly accomplished and nasty Curse Hunter. He is famous for his brutal methods of scorched earth strategy, and while Marion knows that sometimes the death of the innocent is inescapable, she detests Adok for his lack of care and wide use of brute force.

13. Fears

- losing those who are important to her the most.
- The Fiend!!!
- Dying without impacting the world
- Not being able to take revenge for her friends and comrades
- her brother figuring out what she did
-
