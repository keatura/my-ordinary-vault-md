Onyxia is a relatively closed off country, populated almost entirely by Dwarves. Onyxia is a self sustaining country who tends to avoid interactions with the others outside of the countries main export; technology. Dwarven engineers and mechanics and scientists are legendary in every corner of Andefaelt, representing the pinnacle of innovation and creation, and the combining of magic and machine. Dwarves prefer the comfort of stone and steel, and make up for their closed off nation and lower population with armies of automatons to do meager tasks. The Dwarves primarily worship Diorythis, the god of creation, and this is majorly due to her creating the Dwarves as her subjects.
