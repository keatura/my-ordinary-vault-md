Most modern crafted armor is at least slightly imbued with Runesteel, allowing for protection against firearms. Even when lacking any enchantments, armor is magically reinforced to be able to withhold the forces of bullet impacts, but this magic is not strong enough to prevent dents or damage from going through. These wards feed off of the general energy in the air, and can sustain themselves with no need for extra power.
