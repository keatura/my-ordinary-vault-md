Thanks to extensive practice with guns, you gain the following benefits:

- With guns you are proficient in, you my reload them as a bonus action, instead of an action.

- Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesnâ€™t impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls.

- When you use the Attack action and attack with a one handed weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack with a simple firearm you are holding with one hand.
