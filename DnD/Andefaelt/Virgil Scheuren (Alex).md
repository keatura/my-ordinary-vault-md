The smog was interesting. Thicker than my village. Immediately I thought I'd miss the days of going to my cabin and throwing down the firewood. But there was work to be done here. My name is Virgil Scheuren. I come from the cold peaks. People didn't like my line of work. But why not make what you're good at your job? I'm a bounty hunter. For years now I've dealt with the metaphorical shit in the streets that harm the lies of the good folk. But thieves and assholes are far from the worst. I'm looking for a man. A foreigner - a man who butchered my wife and daughter. I don't care how many guns and pieces of tech my foes have. They hide away behind it all, afraid. They've made a terrible decision. I'm a man with few qualms. Almost none after my anchors were slaughtered. I'm gonna find you, fuckhead. Better start praying.
