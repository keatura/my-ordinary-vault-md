The Asyrian Empire is the most military power of the four nations. They control much of the land surround Ederna, and worship the Storm as an idol of the gods. The population consists primarily of Humans and Ukucha, beings of chaotic energy thought be children of the Storm itself. The locations of the Empire around the Storm means they have comfortable lives and never suffer droughts, though rain is common, especially during the raining season where rain is consistent at least three or four times a week. The people of Asyria believe that they are closer to the gods than every other nation, and are a very religious nation, run by a King and Queen, who have political and religious rule over the country.
