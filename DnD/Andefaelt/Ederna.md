Ederna, The Eternal Storm, is the most important figure of Andefaelt. It represents a benevolent being, whether sentient or not is unknown. Some, such as the Asyrians choose to worship Ederna as an idol of the gods, while others choose to simply appreciate Ederna for the resources it provides. Ederna itself is a black twisting storm of extreme winds constantly moving in a vortex. It reaches as far as the eye can see into the sky and down below the Mist. Creatures of immense power lurk within the darkness of Ederna, and the Storm is the Mother of All. Gods may have created life, but Ederna is so ancient as to predate the gods, and is the creator of the Islands the gods created their people to live on, as well as the resources these people use to survive. 

Ederna is the embodiment of chaos, demonstrated by the Ukucha, descendants not of Diorythis but of Ederna, creatures that embody Chaos.
