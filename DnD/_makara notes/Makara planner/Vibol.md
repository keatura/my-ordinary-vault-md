Vibol is Makara's main guardian and father figure. He is a soldier/guard that found work in House Erfir, and was also the soldier that found Makara and was tasked with raising her. He has never told Makara his involvement in the raid or the existence of her past, as he and his family would most likely be executed if he did. Vibol did his best to raise Makara. He was her teacher, father, and friend when she did not have any. 

Now Vibol is old and retired, and lives well-off with his wife in an apartment towards the center of the city. He and Makara still send letters to each other when Makara leaves the city for her duties, and now as Makara has started having more freedom from her parents, he has been helping her discover the true nature of her past, without telling her, as he does not want to be executed.
