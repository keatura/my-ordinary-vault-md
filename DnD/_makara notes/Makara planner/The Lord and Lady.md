Your adoptive parents names are Lady Haviea (Have-A-Eeah) and Lord Luther. Haviea is and always has been the most strict with you. she is very demanding of you and helicopters everything you do. What you eat, what you wear, how you train, who you fight, stuff like that. Sheâ€™s also the one trying to arrange for you a marriage as fast as she can. After the war the house is finally financially stable enough to fund one, but luckily she is very picky with suiters. Your father, Lord Luther, is much more neglectful. He is strict yes, but not to a point where polices everything you do. However, he shows you no love.
