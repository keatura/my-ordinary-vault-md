## **It was a sunny day in the capital.** ##

The sand floor of the dueling pit was radiating heat up through Makara's boots. her opponent was just another unlucky Valgo son sent over some dispute of wealth between the houses. Makara walked up to the ringmaster to have her weapons enchanted to be blunted, death was not the objective here anyways. The weight of her sword was familiar in her hands by now, its dark blue crystal blade seeming to absorb the midday sun. After the enchantment was done, she spun around and walked back to her place on the arena. It was a large circular pit of sand with 4 foot high walls on each side, with roped fences around the top. Makara eyed up her opponent, preparing a plan for the upcoming fight. He was the oldest of the Valgo boys and was at least a foot taller than her. He had the height and weight advantage, but she was used to this, Makara was taught from the day she started learning the sword on how to utilize her short stature to fight someone taller than her. She took a deep breath.

The ringmaster climbed to his position at the side of the arena, and called out: "Does each contender promise a fair fight? No tricks, no third party?"
Makara and her opponent agreed.
"Good, now keep it clean. This is just a simple contest over some imports. I do not want to see anything dangerous."

At this announcement, Makara and her opponent both crouched down into aggressive stances, and started approaching each other. as they closed, Makara paused her approach and drew a line in the sand, then flicked her sword at the Valgo son. Now that he was closer, she noticed he was wearing a necklace with a diamond inlayed in the center. *Is he really stupid enough to use magic, in a duel as simple as this?* Makara thought, but the second she had this thought, he reached his free hand towards the necklace and started reciting a spell. In a muscle memory reaction, Makara's non-dominant hand, holding her parrying dagger, threw the blade at him. As he dodged the dagger, she used the opportunity to rush him down. The Valgo son looked at her, and brought his other hand onto the sword and raised it to strike. At the last second, Makara fainted to the right and brought her sword to her left side to counter the blow. ***CRACK***, the magic covering the blades crackled in static energy against each other. Now that she was on his non dominant side and too close for him to counter, Makara slid her sword out of the bind and brought it down on his shoulder in a flash, ending the fight before he had an opportunity to retreat. 

The ringmaster called for the duel to end, and Makara sheathed her sword and took a moment to catch her breath, and then turned around to shake the hand of her opponent to close off the duel. Neither tried to make conversation, as their respective families would likely be furious at them for that, and Makara retrieved her dagger from the sand some feet away. As she was reaching the top of the stairs out of the ring, Lady Haviea was standing there, arms crossed.

"What was with that taunt? you left yourself open to a spell! Imagine the consequences if that went off, and how much mon-"
Makara stared at her mother blankly. "I won, didn't I? I could tell he didn't stand a chance the second I saw how stiff his stance was. I just had to bide my time and wait for an opening."
"First off, don't interrupt me. I understand that you won but that was too close. Next time I don't want to see chicanery like that."
"Yes, Mother."

Makara stopped by a bakery in the inner city on her way back to the house, then sat down under a tree in the yard to practice her violin. she closed her eyes and played through her favorite piece to warm up, the piece Vibol taught her over 16 years ago by now. The soft melodies and and slow tempo fit right in with the cool air in the shade of this willow tree. As Makara finished playing, she was startled by soft clapping from in front of her, her eyes darted open to see Vibol, standing in front of her and smiling with his hands behind his back. 

"How was the duel today? As normal?" he asked.
Makara sighed. "As normal. waited for an opening and closed before he could react."
"Just like how I taught you!" he chuckled.
"Just like how I have been doing for a decade." Makara put down the violin and reached for her bread. 
"Mind if I join you?" said Vibol, as he showed her the cheese and water he had behind him.
Makara smiled. "Nope."
