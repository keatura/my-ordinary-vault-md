Fruzenphara was one of the many dragons who sided with the Godsent during the war. Although her true goal was religious freedom for everyone on Narnash, Empress Razi’Ah promised her she would not harm civilians who worshipped dragons. This was a lie, of corse, Razi’Ah ordered the execution of many dragon worshipping innocents, however Fruzenphara continued to fight alongside her. She thought Razi’Ah was no threat compared to Evegesha, and so she chose what she thought was the lesser of two evils. Fruzenphara could be described as faintly aloof or distracted, but was friendly towards most mortals who came across her. On Frozenplace, the language tabaxi speak (Quizcheq) her name is “Hallanä” which translates to “Perfect Moon”
