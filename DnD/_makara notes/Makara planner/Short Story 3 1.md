38 Years Later.


Makara fuddled with the ring on her right hand. She was nervous, awaiting the start of her families yearly celebration of the Great War's End, and one of the only occasions she cannot have her sword by her side. The whole city was, the buzz on the streets of food carts setting up, carnival games ready to make money off tourists, and her families servants, setting up the summer house. This beautiful mansion, a large square building made of stone bricks of various shades of light brown. The large open courtyard out front leading in directly to a open space, perfect for parties, since that was basically the only thing the house was used for. 

Standing on the Balcony, taking all the sights and sounds in, and preparing herself for the noble formalities to come. Her Mother always invited loads of people to these parties, whether to form deals with or as prospects for an arranged marriage, though she had always been to strict to settle on one. Also among the people invited were those with the money to be there, members of all the noble houses of the city, and occasionally even those you wouldn't expect, like the Druids.

As the preparations were beginning to finish and the sun started to set, a couple people started filtering in through the gate to the courtyard, masks of various visages covering their faces. Sighing, Makara put on her mask, resembling that of a raven, with black frills and silk contrasting silver metal and thread laid into the mask and dress. 

Turning around, and moving around this upper floor that looks down upon the central interior area of the building, she makes her way down to the bar to see her brother, Chantou sitting there in a black suit and mask, resembling that of a raven. 

"Hey Makara, did you invite anyone? Mom actually let us have plus ones this time."

"No, sadly. I mean, who would I invite?"

Chantou nods his head at her, smirking, "Fair point. Y'know, I managed to get a Princess from Frozen Place to show up, this girl Dilys. She should be here sometime soon."

Makara's gaze tightens on her brother. "Mom set you up?"

Waving his hands in front of him, Chantou says "OH, no no. I figured I would invite her as she was already in the city. Stands out like a sore thumb, only Tabaxi I have seen in this city is close to decade."

"A Tabaxi? Interesting, they dont leave the snow often."

As more nobles filtered into the courtyard, one person stands out. White fur with spots like a snow leopard, and standing over a foot taller than Makara, a cat-person wearing a modest white dress and no mask walks into the courtyard. Chantou stands up and calls to her, and her ears twitch towards him and Chantou leads her back to where he was sitting. As she comes back, this person gives a small wave to Makara and smiles at her.

"Hi! I'm Dilys, nice to meet you!"

Makara smiles back, "Nice to meet you, too. I don't see many Tabaxi around here. What brings you here?"

"I just like making maps, I'm out to explore the world and update the maps made by my ancestors!"

Then Dilys' ears twitched, like she heard something.

Glancing up then looking back down, Makara asks "Is something wrong?"

"No, just thought I heard something, don't worry." Dilys said.

As Makara was about to press further, she noticed something even more out of the ordinary. A bird person, resembling a mourning dove, walking through the outskirts of the party, a long orange shawl pulled around her, up over her head and a mask obscuring her eyes, she heads for a side hallway, says something to the guards, and walks through the doors. *What is a Druid doing here?* Thinking to herself, about to get up and follow,

"What's wrong?" Chantou pitches in, "See something?"

"No, no it's fine."

And Dilys' ears twitched again.

Noticing again, Makara asks "Are you sure somethings not wrong, are you hearing something?"

"It's fine, just hearing a weird ticking. Its probably just a clock."

And the party went on. More people showed up, And as the night went on, made their way inside towards the bar. Drinks were served, and everyone was thoroughly enjoying themselves, its a time of celebration after all, the War ended 9 years ago and everyone was happier for it. 

Makara fuddled with her ring again.

It felt off, still. She couldn't exactly explain it but this ticking mentioned by Dilys was weird. *The only clock in the building was placed behind a band the Lady had hired for the party. So why was Dilys hearing this ticking? I know Tabaxi had good hearing, but that would drown in out right? maybe I should chec-*

The Lady seemed to appear in the corner of her vision, "Makara, I have someone for you to make acquaintances with."

"Mother, can it wait? I need to check something quickly, please."

"No!" Clearly upset, but still speaking in a hushed voice, "You do what I tell you, when I tell you. As has been for 29 years of your life!"

Meeting with this man, who didn't live up to scrutiny anyways,
