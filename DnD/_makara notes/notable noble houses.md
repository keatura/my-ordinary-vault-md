House Gyrros: they sold mostly furs and clothing, but not the rich kind. Usually cater to the lower/middle class as they are very affordable. You would perhaps know one or two people from this house but for the most part they stay out of politics.

House Uruo: sold fine metals and weapons, mined the Lyln mountains for them, they’re also starting to dip their toes in the coal mining business. Very influential and political, valued profit over almost everything else. They were also very superstitious, you guys don’t really deal with them very much but you’re not enemies. 

House Jod: sold textiles and paper as well as cotton fabric and they are aggressively political. They are at constant war with their rivals, House Hosanna, and would burn their wear houses and bribe their people. They have also caused trouble for your house, but they never overstepped. 

House Hosanna: sold fabrics and silks, very well known and oddly loved by the lower class. They are partnered with House Gyrros and the two of them would trade and sell eachother resources. However, despite their wonderful reputation among the common folk, they are as corrupt as House Jod and have done many awful things to ensure they stay in power as well as keep their name clean. 

House Ki: your families favorite house, they sell expensive jewelry and cut gems. Often they do business with your family as these objects can be easily enchanted and sold. They are catered very much to the high upper class and are about as snobby as you’d expect, but you probably know a few good people from this house, but they’re all incredibly privileged.

House Valgo: rival house that also sells magic items, in direct competition. Erfir and Valgo have a long standing feud that has resulted in diamond trials between the houses and deaths of family on both sides.
