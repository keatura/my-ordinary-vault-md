# Backstory

Raised in a Temple of the Raven Queen


Child of the Raven Queen, and an unknown father, as he died during Nathaniel's first years of life. Growing up, he served at a church for the Raven Queen, not having much of an idea of what to do with his life. When the news of the Death Curse spread to Waterdeep, he begged the Bishop to allow him to seek out the cause to maybe allow the Raven Queen greater control over her domain of life and death. Through this, he was given an invite from Syndra and is leaving to investigate the Death Curse. 

Nagging at the back of his thoughts, though, is a want to meet his father. He knows he should never try and bring someone back from the dead, as it directly goes against Her wishes, but he wishes he could meet his father and maybe have some biological family again.
