### what I think about (keep doing all of this)
- low magic dark fantasy (obviously)
- the presence of powerful "bosses" throughout the world
- grey morality from npcs and party members
- Berserk, FromSoft games, age of sigmar and warhammer fantasy
- specifically dark souls and bloodborne, less elden ring (probably because it came out after you made the campaign)
- 

### What I will think would help the campaign / advice

- stay in one place longer, unless we want a campaign about travelling 

- travelling a lot is fine but most of the time a game like that is an experience more akin to LOTR and other high fantasy

- more basic encounters (even if they are difficult, it should be just against some blasphemer troops or thugs or whatever)

- your campaign lends itself to more combat focus, so design maps for encounters (doesn't have to be for all of them dw) ALSO I can bring a dry erase square grid map OR we can play gridless at gamers-corps or something on one of the 6x4 tables. I can help with encounter design so do not be afraid to ask. DnD encounters would generally lend themselves to roughly 2ftx2ft - 4ftx4ft size

- just because I said that doesn't mean you should have sections of time focused on puzzle solving, I remember some good puzzles from the previous blood and blasphemy campaign, and believe that you can make good puzzles.

- Boss fights should have adds to help with initiative, or give a boss two activations on initiative

- LEGENDARY ACTIONS, LEGENDARY RESISTANCES (like 3 or more) these also help with initiative abuse, and as a cleric Enjoyer, bestow curse and hold person are cancer and can ruin single enemy boss fights without legendary resistance. Legendary resistance doesn't feel cheap, because the boss failed the save and used one of it's very limited resources, which feels rewarding even if the CC spell didn't properly "go off"

- settings like this generally lend themselves to having one or more active wars going on, so think about how those would affect the party and people living in the world. A lot of people would have lost family/ friends before and how that would effect someone.

- to go back on a previous point, whether or not I believe a combat focused campaign fits here, the rest of the party does not enjoy combat as much as RP and adventuring, and I really enjoy that time of game too

- the first "arc" of the OG campaign was really fun

- walking through dirty narrow city streets with SOMETHING watching us was a really cool feeling and I enjoyed that

- the whole sequence breaking into the house, investigating, and having the fight was well done

- when we left the city to that town to fight the Big Creature (my memory is rough at this point) was also well done, and stuff like that is a good way for a quest or objective to progress (travel, investigate, fight, with a dungeon thrown in occasionally)

- don't balance bosses on CR, you can always adjust a bosses HP mid-fight and none of us will ever know, learning game balance is mostly a method of trial and error

- quick tip, most of the time making the damage smaller than you think it should be will be better for balance

- a lot of REALLY GOD damage spells like divine favor add 1d4 bonus damage to your attacks

- a good way to determine boss HP is actually to take the weapons the party uses plus their spells, and use math to average out their damage per turn ( dont include spells, as these are inconsistent because of the limited availability and have high damage on purpose) use this average damage per turn to help decide how long the boss should be able to hold up

- actively think about including ranged enemies to pressure spellcasters and also even enemy spellcasters can make for an interesting combat encounter

- enemy spellcasters can have spells like hold person, but try to steer away from hard CC like and have ones with more agency in their counter-play like silence. Hard CC is effective but losing your ability to play the game is objectively unfun and should be used to sparingly.

- silence is a good example because it prevents spells from being cast, and can force one of the party members out of a good position in order to cast spells, leading to them putting themselves into danger

hope this helps, a lot of this is opinionated and I have less real DMing experience than you, so of course don't follow any of this exactly, it is mainly to help with general design
