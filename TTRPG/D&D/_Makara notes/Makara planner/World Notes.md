1. House Valgo would’ve beefed with you a ton, they imported goods from Saze (mostly expensive glass and jewelry mined from the Great Divide). Your house is closer to Emperor Shoga’s Royal house but for as long as you’ve been alive theyve been working their way closer and closer to his favor. That’s smth your Mum doesn’t like
2. Tien’Gong The Eldest Red Dragon disappeared about half a year before the war started and many believe her disappearance was what really started the war
3. So basic info on Elves it that they live to abt 100-150 years old, live mostly on Dyami and in nomadic tribes that travel across the Great Plains and there are a few dozen different tribes, and have always had trouble with the kingdoms and have consistently gotten their land stolen and people killed They even have their own Pantheon of gods, and think Dragons are angels sent by these gods
4. Aristolia is a region of Dyami that is kept for its historical significance
5. Al-Saze was established when they had finally regained their independence from Aristolia like a few hundred years ago, and when Saze said “ok your gonna be apart of us now” they said “nuh uh” and created their own country. Unlike Saze, Al-Saze is ruled by a king or queen and is more culturally similar to East Dyami then Saze. Their current ruler is Queen Zalika and Al-Saze sided with the Dragonsent during the war
6. AwayPlace is owned by Saze, and Al-Saze is a different kingdom from Saze. FrozenPlace has no banner bc it does not have a unified gov, however In the past few years Dyami has been trying to become more influential on the island by sponsoring cities that are led by Dyamian puppet politicians
7. The Pernese Forest was destroyed during the war, it was cut down for wood to feed the empire. This displaced the Aarakocra and Elves who were living in the forest, as well as infuriated the Eldest Green Dragon SIngfig and her sister Hafshu, both of which lived in the forest.
