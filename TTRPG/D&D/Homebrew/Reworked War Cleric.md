### Bonus Proficiency

At 1st level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons and heavy armor.

### War Priest

As a bonus action, you can make one attack with a weapon or an unarmed strike.

You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a Short or Long est.

### Channel Divinity: Aura of War

At 2nd level, You present your holy symbol as an action, creating an aura of war to surround you and any allies within 30 ft of you for 1 minute, granting them the following benefits:

- They may add your wisdom modifier as bonus radiant damage to the first weapon attack they hit each turn.

### War Godâ€™s Blessing

At 6th level, you can expend a use of your Channel Divinity to cast Shield of Faith or Spiritual Weapon rather than expending a spell slot. When you cast either spell in this way, the spell does not require Concentration. Instead, the spell lasts for 1 minute, but ends early if you cast that spell again, have the Incapacitated condition, or die.

### Divine Strike

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

### Avatar of Battle

At 17th level, you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical attacks. Your War Priest feature can also be used for free, once per turn, to a maximum of two times per turn. Additionally, if you start combat with no charges of War Priest left then you regain one charge of War Priest.
