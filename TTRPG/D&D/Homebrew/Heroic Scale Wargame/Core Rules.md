# Wargame rules for Dungeons and Dragons 5e

  
### The Purpose of this PDF.
The point of this ruleset is to expand upon DnD’s current combat rules to allow for more fluidity during battles that take place on an army scale. Its size will be similar to current popular wargames such as 40k, and also take inspiration from games such as One Page Rules. The main staying point of this system is to allow the players to have a large impact on the battlefield, whether they choose to do so directly or indirectly. Though the gameplay will result in something similar to a wargame, the DM still takes an important role in setting up the game and encounters.



### Tools you may want, before using these rules (OPTIONAL)

- Tape measure (if you are playing gridless)
- Laser line of sight marker (just for quality of life)
- 2d OR 3d terrain (recommended)
- At least a 4x4 foot table, preferably a 4x6 foot table
- Tokens to keep track of what has gone and status effects

  

Before the rules start, some important distinctions:

- **Models** are any model in play, on the board. This means that both a **Hero**, and one model within a unit are both considered models.

- **Heroes** are player characters and important NPCs, and any model that has a bonus action; These models should generally be limited to less than 3 for the enemy sides, and whatever player characters make up the main party. These models are the only ones to activate on the Heroic Phase.

- **Characters** are minor characters, these activate as solo models like a character, but do not get many of the unique traits of characters. **Models** do not have a bonus action, and do not activate on the **Heroic Phase**.

- **Units** are large groups of **Models**, the size of which is decided by the DM. The general good sizings for these units are 3 for large size creatures, such as ogres. 5 for small conflicts and more specialized units, such as a cavalry unit. If the players are in an especially large battle consider upping the size to 10 to prevent initiative slog. Infantry **Units** are where the size will vary the most, all depending on the type of creature in the unit. If it's a unit of knights serving a king that are well trained, they would most likely be in a unit of 10, while a lightly trained militia may be in a group of 20, and a horde of zombies going all the way up to 40-50.

  

### Chapter 1: Action Economy

The action economy for the sake of simplicity will be simpler than standard DnD. Player characters and important enemies decided by the DM will still have bonus actions, but any unnamed grunt and non-PC's/important NPCs will only have an action and reaction. Players may choose whatever activation style they choose, or is comfortable for their table. Though sticking with standard DnD initiative rolls for each hero, character and unit is advised for players who are less experienced with wargames or wish to keep rules similar.

  

Turn structure:

Turns are split up into multiple phases, with each one occurring after each other before the turn ends. The turn order plays as such;

1. **Heroic Phase**

2. **Battle phase**

3. **Clean up**



The combat will be further detailed in the combat chapter, but for now each phase comes with some unique traits.

The **Heroic Phase** is where all **Heroes** activate independently of **Characters** and **Units**. **Heroes** take their turns as normal, performing action, bonus action, and free action. If the player character has a special guard unit that they directly control, this unit activates with that player on their initiative. For activation structure, you may use initiative order as DnD is meant to be played, or any other order your group prefers.

The **Battle Phase** is the normal combat phase of the game. This is where all **Characters** and **Units** activate and take their actions. An important part to note here is that while they have their own phase, **Heroes** still get to make an activation during this phase, meaning they go twice. For the sake of spell timers, the **Heroic Phase** and **Battle Phase** together count as two separate turns, meaning one full turn is 12 seconds.

Finally, the Clean-up Phase is not necessarily an important phase, but it is recommended to take a moment to clean up any markers that you may have on the field, double check spell timers and concentration, etc.

### Chapter 2: Movement

Movement is exactly the same as DnD. The game is playable both on the RAW 5ft squares, and also if you wish to play gridless, you can treat 1” as 5ft of movement, so therefore a human would be able to move 6” a turn, while dwarves can move 5” and wood elves can move 7”

  

**Dashing** and **Charging**:

**Dashing** also follows the trend, and functions the same as DnD. **Charging** is the same as **Dashing**, but **Units** cannot make a charge against **Heroes** and **Characters**, and you make an attack as you enter melee with the opposing unit. You make this attack with every single model in the **Unit**, not just half. If a charge is declared with a **Character** or **Hero**, they make one additional attack in addition to their normal attacks, though **Heroes** use their bonus action to make a charge. Failed charges still apply to **Characters** and **Heroes**.

### Chapter 3: Combat

The final part to make the game work, **Combat**. To slim down calculations with large units engaging in combat, Units **have** their stat blocks condensed. To start, a normal medium size man-at-arms would have 10hp. This means that the grunts for most any army would have 10hp, and base hp values around this. 

  

First of all, the simplest, **Heroes**.

  

Due to **Heroes** being normal, full character sheets for DnD 5e, their moving and attacks are as normal, with one big exception. All attacks made by a **Character** or **Hero** towards a **Unit** automatically crit. 

  

Then we move onto **Units**.

  

**Units** have some differences to normal DnD 5e combat. First of all, if a **Unit** makes a normal melee or ranged attack against an enemy target, they may only make an amount of attacks equal to half the size of the unit.**
