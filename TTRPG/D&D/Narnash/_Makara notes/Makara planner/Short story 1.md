## **7 years after the raid, 7 years before the war.**

The classroom was a peculiar place. It never seemed to be able to keep a consistent feeling. When you spend time in it, it's a time prison, the most boring place in the world. Then, when you leave and have to go back to the Lord and Lady Erfir, you are reminded of why the classroom seems so appealing. In the classroom, which was actually just an old guest bedroom (but we never have guests), there seemed to be everything you could want. A bookshelf on the rear wall with books from everything from fact to history to fiction, a large window that lets the afternoon sun in, and one large table in the center, with two chairs. From where I sat, looking towards the bookshelf stood a peculiar man, who was also my teacher. Mr. Therin, though he always let me refer to him as Vibol. He stood just a few inches taller than me, maybe 5’6”, with dark skin and black hair. and he has been around for as long as I can remember.

From my earliest memories, I can remember Vibol always being the one there to protect me. Never the Lord and Lady, who I guess would be my parents. He was my assigned guard, and also the man I consider to be my dad. He was also my teacher.

“Makara, are you zoning out again? I know this is a boring subject but it is vital for you to understand. Knowing the history of your family is important.”

I frowned, and looked over from the window to match his gaze. His cotton bright lavender vest and poofy black and purple pants glowing in the midday's light. 

“Sorry Vibol. I was getting distracted thinking about this book I started reading recently.”

“Oh, and what book is that?” he asked.

“I started reading this book on the violin, it’s such a beautiful instrument. Can you teach me how to play it? These lessons on history are sooo boring.”

“I could certainly try. Say, why don't you give me a month or two and I'll come back to it, why don't you keep reading about that for now? If we finish this lesson, I can give you a book on reading music.”

And then some months pass.

And as summer turned to fall, I found myself unable to sleep one night, my bed was too cold and needed another blanket. I headed down to the closet down the hall and as I walked I heard the sound of a violin coming from another room. As I opened up the door, and peered through, I saw Vibol practicing next to a dim light with some sheet music in front of him. I watched him intently as he played through the piece, though there were some hiccups that seemed to be mistakes, he kept going and played to the best of his ability. As he finished playing, Vibol turned around and looked towards me,

“Surprise! I guess.” he chuckled, “I was teaching myself how to play so maybe I could teach you how to play in your free time, was saving it as a surprise for your birthday though.”

“Really??” I walked up to him, “Can you start teaching me now?” I smirked. “Now that I know your secret.”

Vibol’s eyes glanced away for a second and his smile sort of faded as I said that, but was back before I noticed. “Sure, Makara. We can start now, who knows, maybe it will make your Mother happy.” 

“Hopefully.” I grabbed another chair in the room and pulled it over next to him, “So how do we start?”

  

This winter was especially cold. After my birthday had come and passed, Mother soon found out that Vibol was teaching me violin, though she did not object as she viewed it as “ladylike” and allowed us to continue. One day, as I was practicing some scales after my normal history lesson, Lady Haviea walked in on us.  
  

“Play me a song.” She stated. “All these lessons are for nothing if you can't play.” 

Vibol looked over at her, and I turned to her to speak up, but I decided it was best to just listen. “Yes, mother. I will try my best” Vibol handed me the sheet music for my current favorite song, as that is the one we have been working on the most. I picked up my violin, placed it to my chin, took a deep breath and started playing. As I was playing I felt something.. Different. As I was playing the piece, I felt as if I was flowing from note to note like I never have managed to before, not even making mistakes at the parts I would normally. And I felt some kind of energy surrounding me as I played the crescendos and ties. Mother's eyes lit up at me in a way I never have imagined they could. As I was playing, I glanced over at Vibol, and he was smiling at me, proud of the progress I have made. When I finished playing, she looked at me.

“Makara, you are from now on, going to be taking private lessons after your normal classes. You also will have to be ready to learn some magic. I will find you a teacher, be in the main entrance after your classes tomorrow, and be on time.”

“Mother, what about Vibol? He has been the one teaching me, and he-”

“Vibol is a soldier, Makara. He may have taught himself how to play, but you need a real teacher.” 

I looked over at Vibol, and he nodded back at me encouragingly. “I can still play with you, hell you may even start teaching me.” He chuckled.

The next day, I found myself being rushed towards the front of the house after my classes. This was the routine until well after winter ended and into spring. After my normal classes, I would be taken into the inner city for strict music lessons that were supervised by Lady Haviea, and then when I returned home, I would be forced to recite spells and learn about the fundamentals of magic. All this culminated one day in late spring, when while playing the same song I played many months ago that started all this, I formed an illusion in front of me, showing pictures to accompany the song as I played. The next day, When I headed to the entrance to get ready for my music lessons, Lady Haviea was standing there, as she usually does, but this time carrying a sword in a sheath with an ornate hilt and pommel.

Lady Haviea glanced over at me as I entered the room. “Ah, Makara. It’s about time we started with some more.. Important skills. Here.” She walked over to me and put this sword into my hands, although the familiar weight of a sword did not come, it felt familiar, almost as if it was the same weight of my violin.

“Why are you giving me this now, Mother? What about my violin lessons?”

“You will be going to those less often now, though I still expect you to practice as often as you did before. But now, I need you to learn to use a sword. What purpose is someone like you if you cannot defend our house? You will learn how to use this sword, be glad I am even allowing you to touch something as precious as this. Now go on, look at your gift.”

I did as I was told, unsheathing the sword to reveal a beautiful crystal blade, with scratches etched into the base, up to around the midpoint of the blade. As I shifted it around, I noticed that the light seemed to not reflect off of the crystal, leaving it looking dull.

“Makara, this sword is worth more than your life and I expect you to protect it as so. From now on, this will be part of your training in the magical arts. I expect you to make time to practice with this sword, just like how you practice your violin.” She kneeled down in front of me, and helped me attach the sheath to my belt. “I also expect to see you wearing this as you walk around. Get used to it, you will be doing it for the rest of your life.”

The next day, when I walked into the classroom, Vibol looked over to greet me, and seemed shocked at this new sword. “W-..” He took a brief moment to compose himself. “Where did you get that, Makara?”

“Mother gave it to me before my music lessons yesterday. She told me that I had to learn how to use it, and I wouldnt get to go to my violin lessons as much anymore.”

Vibol muttered something under his breath, but before I could ask, he stopped me. “Well, I guess your mother wants to teach you to defend yourself. But Makara, promise me you will keep that sword safe. Ignoring whatever she said about its value, that sword is extremely important, and once you grow up I will help you learn more about it. For now, you just have to forget that I told you this.”

“Why can’t you tell me about it, V-”  
Vibol holds up his hand, as to quiet me like he normally has during my classes. He looks down at his feet, “Makara, we have to focus on your school, now let's get back to some math, ok?”

“I-, ok. I promise Vibol.”

“-sorry”
