- Makara (Mak-uh-rea)

- Makara was born to an elven tribe, which was attacked and raided by the human house Erfir when she was an infant

- She was given an enchanted signet ring as a child and told that she should never take it off

- The ring has enchantment magic that causes her to never think about the ring and never consciously notice it's there, and also changes her appearance to resemble those of house Erfir.

- Taken in at 8 months, House Erfir “adopted” her to harness her more innate magical energies as an elf. The House tried many different things, but noticed a special connection to music and performance that allowed her to bring her magic forth.

- After this, Makara was rigorously trained in the Violin, Cello, and Lute, and taught extensive sword fighting, basically consuming her entire life outside of her education.

- She was taught that she was supposed to provide use to the house, and it was drilled into her head that if she did not fulfill that purpose, she would be of no value and would be disowned. 

- Makara was taught everything she needed to know to be a proper noble, and then some. Repetitive lessons of everything important about the history of Dyami and was also kept involved in the war to learn about the concepts of warfare.

 - As she matured, Makara became more obedient as she settled into the lifestyle forced upon her. Always worried about looking her best, making a good image for the House. She had to worry about her upcoming duels to settle disagreements between family members she has never even spoken to. And no matter what, she was confident she could win. If not because of an ego, then because she had the training drilled into for decades.
 
- As the war came to a close and she grew older, Makara started to realize that despite being in her late 30’s now, she still looks and can perform the same as she did when was at her supposed “peak”

- She also notices the traditionally elven looking (ancient elven runes) scripture along the base of the blade and moving up towards the center of the blade, on both sides. She originally thought it was just a magic item due to its lightness and keen edge, and also because of its innate ability to seem to channel magic. This caused her to finally notice something, she sometimes will receive unwanted emotions, as though they are coming from the sword. She realizes that whenever she is just training by herself the sword is trying to… communicate with her?

- Through all of this, a man named Vibol (the soldier who was instructed to take her after the raid of her original elven tribe) has been her best and only friend, acting more as a father figure. He raised her to the best of his ability within his ability as a family guardsman. He never told her about her past or that he took her, not only because that would create more problems than it's worth for everyone, he would also be sentenced to execution of the Erfir family.

- Now that Makara is growing older and Vibol is retired, she has been gaining more freedom but is still required to attend to her duties, the same way she has been for decades. She still visits Vibol who now lives in retirement with his wife, and will write letters to him updating him on her findings of the sword. 

- Makara uses a lot of her newfound free time trying to figure out who she was born to, and where she actually came from if not House Erfir

- Makara still doesn't have much time between her duties to do her research, and cannot bring anything home to prevent the Lord and Lady from getting suspicious of her personal activities. 

- Makara's mother is trying to marry her off for a political advantage.
