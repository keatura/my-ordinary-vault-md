Hi! I'm just making sure your commissions are still open.

I have commissioned you previously (on artists & clients), and would like to commission some more art + a slight redesign of my character.
She is 5'3" and an elf, the sword is 4' in length
She is sitting on a plain white naval hammock hanging from the mast of a sailing boat, playing her violin. Under her head is a simple pillow as she reclines with her right leg hanging free off the side, relaxing. her boots are the same thigh-length boots as before but in a darker leather with laces that go all the way down, and her clothes are neatly tucked under her, with her lavender coat and some of the other white cloths draping over the side. Her pants are black and form fitting. She has her right white glove on, which is just a silk glove like in the original art, but her left glove is off while she plays.
As she is playing, her sword is sat between her legs, and cradled in her right arm as she plays.
She has the breastplate on
