Hi! I'm just making sure your commissions are still open.

----

I would like to commission an illustration.

She is 5'3" and an elf, her ears are quite long and stick out to the side. Her eyes are hazel. the sword is 4 feet in length

She is sitting on a plain white naval hammock hanging from the mast of a sailing boat, playing her violin. Under her head is a simple pillow as she reclines with her right leg hanging free off the side, relaxing. her boots are the same thigh-length boots as in her original design, but in a darker leather with laces that go all the way down, and her clothes are neatly tucked under her, with her lavender coat and some of the other white cloths draping over the side. Her pants are black and form fitting. She has white silk gloves and her breastplate armor on.

As she is playing, her sword is sat between her legs, and cradled in her right arm as she plays. the left 4 runes of the 2 columns display on the scabbard (in the same spots as the animals on the scabbard reference)

I would like to commission two things: a fully-body and an item (a helmet)

She is 5'3" and an elf, her ears are quite long and stick out to the side. Her eyes are hazel. the sword is 4 feet in length.

She is standing, relaxed, like in the pose ref with the sword out and a round shield, facing away from her. The underside is a medium brown wood like oak, and dark leather straps to hold it. The crystalline blade is a dark blue, with the runes etched into it (the left set of four on the ref) faintly glowing a lighter sky blue. the scabbard for it in on her left hip, held at the same position as the reference for the belt.

Her armor is a mix of plate and brigandine. with the breastplate, pauldrons and gauntlets being polished steel plate with a black brigandine skirt below, and regular leather boots with black pants underneath. Underneath the plate, along her joints and the area between the pauldrons and the gauntlets she has a lavender coat.
