Hi! I'm just making sure your commissions are still open.

----

I would like to commission an illustration.

She is 5'3" and an elf, her ears are quite long and stick out to the side. Her eyes are hazel. the sword is 4 feet in length

She is sitting on a plain white naval hammock hanging from the mast of a sailing boat, playing her violin. Under her head is a simple pillow as she reclines with her right leg hanging free off the side, relaxing. her boots are the same thigh-length boots as in her original design, but in a darker leather with laces that go all the way down, and her clothes are neatly tucked under her, with her lavender coat and some of the other white cloths draping over the side. Her pants are black and form fitting. She has white silk gloves and her breastplate armor on.

As she is playing, her sword is sat between her legs, and cradled in her right arm as she plays. the left 4 runes of the 2 columns display on the scabbard (in the same spots as the animals on the scabbard reference)
