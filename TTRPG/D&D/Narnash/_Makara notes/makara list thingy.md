1. **Why do they do what they do**

Makara follows her family biddings out of both a desire to not disappoint those who raised her, and a subconscious need to be useful to those she deems worthy of her company. She also does it out of a more selfish want to keep her status. Makara is comfortable in her life and despite the downs of noble life, she likes the money, the power, and- until recently- the safety.

2. **Do they have any friends, if so how is that going for them, what are they like, who are they, how did they meet**

Makara has a few friends, but her main relationships are with her brother Chantou, and her father figure and (now retired) personal guard Vibol. she doesn't have many friendships outside of those two, most of her other relations are for political reasons, or just acquaintances.

Growing up Vibol was her closest relationship, he did everything he could to raise her where parents didn't, and personally learned the violin just to teach her. (which is why it is her favorite instrument, and why she always carries one.) While she doesn't know the real reason why he was assigned to be her caretaker, there is a familial bond between the two. 

Chantou is Makara's younger brother by a few years, and he is the closest thing she has to a real friend. Despite their familial bond, Makara and Chantou are genuinely friends and care for each other, helping each other through whatever one of them could need. They help each other with their parents, with relationships, and anything else that may come up. Chantou is a lot less straight edge than Makara (even though she still does drink, especially when things are *very* fucked.) and tends to drink heavily when given the chance or when no dangers are immediately apparent, and she ends up having to bail him out of messes he gets into.

3. **Past relationships? What’s the current standing on that, are they still going, are yall chill or nah, etc. If they are still going for how long, are you happy with it, how deep it go, etc.**

Makara has a few past relationships with children of the other houses, mainly Gyrros and Ki. men and women from various houses her mother has tried to marry her off to- but with no avail. 

**3a. House Gyrros**
Makara has a few relationships within house Gyrros, but nothing serious. Her main connection is a man named Nikolai, who she has know for some decades and serves as a contact within the house.

**3b. House Ki**
Makara has a some actual friendships within House Ki. 

Zether- nephew of the houses matriarch, Caracalla. He’s snobby and obnoxious, but in a kind of funny tolerable way. He has a surprising amount of power within the house and is VERY good with people, which is way Caracalla brings him on diplomatic meetings with other houses, including yours

Perrine- the black sheep, Perrine is kind of the estranged artist of the family. She’s quiet and is often found sitting alone in the corner during parties or meetings, that’s actually probably how you met her. She’s very insightful and has a surprising amount of humility for someone of her social status.

There is also of course Caracalla herself, but she is very particular about who she talks to

1. **Familial relationships**

Makara has a complicated relationship with her family. Her mother and father gave her everything she wanted and give her everything she needs just about, but they want her to stay quiet and follow orders, even now as she gets older. Her older brother Tuldan is so caught up in the Kings court that he has virtually no relationship with Makara, and never makes it home for very long when he does come home. Though Makara's parents keep in close touch with him. Theres also Chantou, and lastly, the forgotten child, Kiri.

First of all, Makara's Mother, Lady Haviea Erfir. She is the head of the house, makes most of the major decisions, manages Makara, and carries the house name, which her Father inherited. Makara's relationship with her mom is rough. She loves her mom, and accepts that she did raise her, but holds resentment for the unrealistic expectations and incessant scolding that she has been subject to for all 46 years of her life. 

Makara's Father never had much impact on her. He mostly stood passively and let her mother do everything needed to be done. Makara's father is a unassertive, non-confrontational man who prefers to stay out of politics and spend a lot of his time managing house funds or reading. The only major effect he had on Makara is helping her learn magic and tutoring her during her schooling, which was not always a positive experience.

Kiri is the forgotten child of the family. She never lived up to her mothers expectations like Makara did (though she was never given the same opportunities as Makara), and while they had a good relationship in their teenage years, Kiri has grown to resent Makara. as Makara flourished under the pressure set by her parents while Kiri crumbled under the weight. Kiri spends a lot of her time hiding from her parents, avoiding what conflict she can with them. Her friends mostly consist of people outside the realm of nobility, and while she has never had to work a day in her life, she helps her friends out where she can. While Kiri holds negativity and resentment for Makara, the hatred is not returned, though Makara can get frustrated when dealing with her younger sister. 

5. **Beliefs**

Makara, through her experience of life, believes hard work rewards the worker. (while ignorant of the privileges of the noble life granted to her) Makara has fought to be accepted and given gratitude by her parents her whole life, and therefore believes that others can achieve a result like hers by working hard. 

6. **Morals and values**

Makara's morals, while deep down, are like any normal persons, the decades of noble life and conditioning from her parents have caused to her care less and less about the morality of what she does, and more about the result. She has never properly learned the direct consequences of her actions. Instead, she worries more about her parents reaction to it, causing her morals to be very aligned with her parents.

Makara values trust, talent, and character.

7. **Limits (Where’s the line, what would it take to cross it, why are the limits there)**

Makara's limits have been blurred by her poor moral code. While she doesn't take pleasure in, or even enjoy, some of the darker aspects of her role in the house, she nearly lacks a line to cross except for a few specific things. Makara will not:
a. indirectly or directly cause harm to a child 
b. commit mass murder of innocents
c. follow objectively inherently evil orders, even from her own parents
d. she will never lay a finger on her siblings in a harmful manner, for any reason.

8. **Faith (Religion, code, stuff like that, do they follow those thingies?)**

Makara does not worship any specific god of Narnash. She accepts the fact that the gods are real, but is not devout or committed to any specific one, and also does not despise the dragons.

9. **Valued belongings**

Makara's most prized possession is her sword; a beautifully crafted crystal blue blade with runes inscribed on it, attached to a polished steel and walnut grip. This sword was gifted to her at a young age, and she learned to defend herself and fight others with it. Over time she began to realize that at least in some subtle manner, the sword is sentient. 

Makara's other most valuable possession is the necklace gifted to her from Kiri, it's a simple silver snowflake crystal shape, with a sapphire in the center, of which Kiri has a matching emblem of a maple leaf, embedded with a emerald to contrast winter to summer (their respective favorite seasons.) Makara does not know if Kiri still wears hers, but Makara keeps it on under her shirt nearly all the time.

10. **Where do they live, do they like it, where would they like to live**

Makara lives in the inner city of Sarphan. She lives in a large family owned manor of House Erfir, and as far as she knows, would not switch it out for anything. 

11. **What do they hate, pet peeves too**

Makara HATES unmotivated, non driven people. She thinks they are weak morally, mentally, and physically, too scared to truly embrace what they believe needs to be changed in the world, no matter what views they may hold. She also hates it when she or her peers are not presentable. She was raised on the belief that one must always be presentable as you never know when you may have to be presentable, and those who don't keep themselves presentable annoy her. 

Some pet peeves she has is dirt getting on her, or her clothes. She hates the texture and will take any opportunity she can to clean herself.

12. **Does anyone hate them, do they hate anyone**

Adrian Valgo and Makara shared a mutual hatred. Adrian grew up in a similar role to Makara, raised to be the champion of his house, and due to their houses rivalry, they grew up enemies. The two hated each others guts until Erfir challenged Valgo to a Diamond Trial to restore their honor after Makara went off to investigate into the bombing of her families summer house. This resulted in Makara quite brutally killing Adrian.
