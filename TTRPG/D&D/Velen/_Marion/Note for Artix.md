Dear Artix,

My time has come to leave. Thank you for your excellent leadership, your strength, you kept us together. I let my hate take over, and made things worse, more difficult. I diluted my control on the mission and I... messed up real bad.

I'm sorry I couldn't give you this letter in person, but I can't have you stopping me. I am leaving, and when you decide to finally finish The Cardinal, meet me in the Lightkeep. I will be waiting there.

Genuinely, thank you for seeing the truth in my actions, and for helping me so much.

May Selestis bless you and guide your path, Artix.
