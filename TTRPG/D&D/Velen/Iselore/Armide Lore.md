###### Motivation
Armide's true goal is to bring back the Circle. Even if it means herself or those she travels with die in the process.

Armide, at her core, is a conflicted person. She both wants nothing more than the power to do everything she needs to herself, and at the same time craves connection to someone else. She closed herself off due to Vrazda's betrayal, forced herself to stay strong because of it and pushed away everyone she knew, as if subconsciously to make leaving them easier. She convinced herself human connection was futile, yet the second she finds someone going through something similar to her, she backtracks, and wants to connect to them.

###### Greatest Fear
Getting too close to someone and loosing sight of her goals.

###### Physical Appearance
Armide is a extremely frail average height (~~ 5'8") woman, literally skin and bones. She is pale skinned and carries herself fairly heavily 

###### Voice
Armide's voice is raspy and quiet, and generally she sounds sickly at all times. She coughs fairly frequently, sometimes even coughing up blood and casting more powerful magic makes her short of breath, Though she can ignore this via the adrenaline rush of combat.

# The Quest for Archdruidship

#### Step 1: Research
- [ ] Investigate into the powerful spellcasters of Velen. Faridoon could be of use.
- [ ] Figure out where the Druid Circles are. Ideally the Circle of the Stars, but that will most definitely prove to be extremely difficult.
- [ ] Convince said Circle(s) to help me through any means possible. Threats and blackmail is NOT ideal but anything to make it work.

#### Step 2

# Backstory

**7362 Days.**

## Childhood under Arduras
(~~ 0-21 years old)

Iselore was born to druidic parents, who were members of the Circle of Stars. Being a half-elf, her mother was an elf and her father a normal human. Living in the Stormwall Mountains, the Circle had many things to worry about, living in high altitude, proximity to the dragons, and the isolation proved to make life difficult for Iselore and her family. But, the Circle was still there. As Iselore grew up, she rose above her peers, showcasing excellent prowess for the druidic magic taught in the Circle. Iselore found her place in the Circle as a powerful caster, showing a true connection to the Stars and fully embracing her role as a defender of the Circle.

## Becoming the Star-mother
(~~ 22 years old)

The issue with living in the mountains is the danger. The Dragons tend to mind their own business, but Wyverns are less rational. So when a Wyvern attacked the Circle in search of food, devastation followed. This Wyvern was abnormal, much larger than others of it's species. It was so large the druids lost many fighting back, including their leader, Star-mother Victoria.

The fight was long and arduous, but one person assembled a fighting force- Iselore. Rallying the remaining druids, she lead them to victory against the Wyvern, and slayed the creature herself. After the dust settled, and the Circle regrouped, it was decided that Drakeslayer Iselore would be named Star-mother, and was given the archdruid title of **Armide**, paying homage to her well known prowess for druidic magic.  

## The Ritual
(~~ 42 years old)
The Sanguine Cults pulled up to the ritual after decades of preparation, killing most of her druids and the spirit guardians of the Grove. After a hard fought battle and the ritual almost complete, a Wizard who addressed himself as "The Bloodstar" walked up in front of her, effectively leading to a duel. Queue some banter and then him saying, "I have been preparing to look for people like you ever since King Adam II died." which is goofy (by the stars I'm screwed). He is a VERY tough opponent, expertly wielding both magic and weapon, and kept Armide distracted and in a one-on-one fight. After a long and close fight, The Bloodstar finds an opening, hits her with a huge bludgeoning attack, and rams his weird staff into her back. After this, she looks up into the sky to see golden dust falling, and she starts to hear strange chanting, which the Bloodstar doesn't seem to notice. After a flash of light, She awakens in a similar plateau to the Grove, but upon further inspection, seems to be in the Feywild.

## The immediate fallout of landing in the Feywild

After being teleported to the Feywild in her weakened state, out of resources and energy, Armide was kidnapped. Deciding to play along and hopefully survive, she allowed it to happen, and once she regained her strength, her captors started to speak of other humanoids being around. After this, Armide got a message in her head:

*There is a way out in (insert spot in cave) and you can be safe (insert nearby directions).*

Soon after this, the Fey kidnappers are killed by a weird monster, and Armide breaks out and runs away. After limping through the woods for a good while, she comes across a town. The town is weird, but it has the normal buildings such as an inn. Walking into the inn, she meets this guy and he asks for Armide's name. He says:

*"Greetings. I'm the one you heard earlier - the name's Vrazda."*

## Vrazda and their time together in the Feywild

Vrazda is a Lietenant of Arduras, and became Anointed soon after entering the Feywild. He was on an expedition, and there was a weird accident that caused him to end up in the Feywild, which lead to his Anointment and gaining of sorcerous powers. While shocked and confused, Vrazda survived and woke up in a battleground between two Fey Lords. Pretending to be a member of one of the armies, he started to learn the gist of Fey society and find a place. Eventually, people started to suspect he wasn't from the Feywild, and was taken prisoner, though through smooth talking he was able to convince the Fey to let him go. He eventually made his way to a small town, where, strangely enough, there was a population of genuine humans. He lied low in this town, concealing his true identity and learning more about the Feywild. After saving Armide, learning that she was the only other person from Velen he had met so far, he claims he was able to agitate the monster to attack Armide's captors. They both share the desire to leave the Feywild, and Vrazda teaches Armide to blend in and gain information.

One of the many things they shared during their time in the Feywild, was the effects of the Anointment. Armide seeing it as the stars above her seeming to talk to her- speaking in a heavenly voice providing guidance and hope, and gifting upon her, her Familiar, who she named Kheda, meaning "Guidance" in Druidic. Vrazda had a similar situation, but he visualized it as a thin thread of light when he closed his eyes.

Eventually, Vrazda grew tired of lying low, and made a ballsy move. He got attention from the human residents of the town and started preaching about his visions of the light, and claimed that it had to do with Selestis' pact with the Fey. Vrazda claimed that the light was trying to guide all of them home - to Velen or Selestia. He gained some followers, but not enough and was promptly locked away. Unsure what to do about this, and missing her only ground in the Feywild, Armide grew lost and hid away for a period of time, where she started to plan a revolt within the town. One night after a few months, she started the revolt. With the small mass of followers they had gained in the initial attempt to cement themselves, Armide led a semi-violent, but ultimately non-lethal revolt in an attempt to have Vrazda released, which resulted in not only an increase in support and Vrazda's release, but a path to work their way into a leadership position of the town.

After the revolt, Vrazda was released and cemented his place in the ecosystem of the town. He started a "Church" of sorts, and allowed Armide into a high ranking position so they could work on plans to escape the Feywild. Over this period of time working together, not only did Vrazda change and accept Armide and her druidic nature, and respecting her worship of the stars, they worked together to design a method to get home. This lead into a romantic relationship between the two, that lasted until the Final Battle.

This "Church of the Light" Vrazda started worked well until it grew too much, and was noticed by the Fey, and was attacked. The battle was vicious, but due to Armide and Vrazda's strength they managed to push the Fey back and Vrazda took some of the more elite members of the attacking force hostage. Vrazda used these captured fey and interrogated them ruthlessly for information onto how to get out of the Feywild.

The major things gained from the interrogations, were:
- There was no clear way, and the ancient temples once used as gateways were closed and in ruins after the murder of Ceres.
- Pan would not be of much help as he has lost his mind, and spent his time living in the forest and was prone to violence.
After a while though, Vrazda had a plan. He pitched to them- *Take control of the Feywild, rule it with an iron fist. Then we would have the power to escape, and get back to Velen, maybe even heal the cursed wound on Armide's back.* 

## The Schism (by Tool)

After the attack on the Church of the Light, and the interrogation of the Fey Elite, Armide and Vrazda set their plan into motion. Vrazda begins to use his charisma to expand the Church, gaining members, and Armide uses her connection to the Feywild as a Druid, and her arcane knowledge to support him.

Vrazda begins to give the Fey Kingdoms ultimatums- join or die. While this did result in allies to help their plan, it also resulted in war. Armide agreed to help Vrazda, but was reluctant to wage such war in the Feywild, especially after all the turmoil with Ceres, Pan, and Hastur. This caused tension to start to worm its way between the two, they started bickering over the plans to escape, though they did not lose trust in one another.

All this tension came to a climax one day, when Armide was approached by an old human man, claiming to be "An old spirit from ages long past." Armide did not buy his claims until this man opened up the sky. He brought Armide with him as he flew over the land of the Feywild, and showed you what she could be. In a moment of placing her trust in Vrazda, Armide chooses to go back and talk to Vrazda about this. She says that this opportunity is her life's work- that she will figure out how to bring Vrazda out of the Feywild after she gains this power. But Vrazda doesn't buy it, and they have the biggest fight of their relationship. He believes that Armide never believed in the plan, that she was just trying to leave him the moment she could, and that she never wanted to leave with him- together. He promises Armide that they just need a little bit longer, they almost have a big enough army to move forward.

Of course, this isn't what Armide wanted. In the end, she chose to stay with Vrazda, and to help finish the takeover of the Feywild and help Vrazda reconstruct the ancient temples and make a portal to finally leave the Feywild, together. There is one fatal flaw stopping this plan, though. The Fiendish Hastur already controls one of the temples, and has been expanding his territory.

After a while, Armide and Vrazda made it to the city of Carcosa with their army. Carcosa was a weird city, with freakish fey architecture and mocking Selestis with lots of gold imagery. They fought through the city, attempting to take it over and kill Hastur.  After heavy losses to their army, Armide and Vrazda made it to Hastur's Palace, but there was one literal thorn in their side- Armide's wound was getting worse and worse, and Hastur's strength was starting to become more apparent. But Vrazda was having none of it. He believed Armide was too strong, and that they **HAD** to succeed here, or Armide truly did not wish to escape together.

Then, when they were so close to finishing the fight and reaching Hastur, Vrazda strikes Armide down, saying she was too weak and that she betrayed him. He believed Armide never truly wanted to leave the Feywild, her Druidic nature was preventing her from doing what **they** need to do and complete **THEIR** goals. His goals.

After this, Vrazda storms off to finish the fight and kill Hastur, leaving Armide for dead, writhing in pain on the floor. As he goes to enter the doors to the palace, they slam shut with strong wind and a figure of locusts materializes in front of the two. A tall, gaunt figure in flowing robes, fully wrapped from head to toe in yellow, and a white mask covering the face. Hastur shows to finish the fight.

But, the fight does not continue. Hastur offers Vrazda a deal, the power to leave the Feywild, in exchange for the land Vrazda conquered. And, directly in front of Armide's eyes, though they are blurry and shot with pain, Vrazda accepts. He looks back at Armide, and says

**"Wish this could've gone differently."**

And Vrazda leaves.

## Prison
(~~ 47-49 years old)
After the betrayal, Armide was left injured and in immense depths of pain on the floor of the throne room. Looking at her almost mockingly, he seemed as if he was going to ask her a question- then turned

# Lore

## The lore and history of Velen
**Current Year: 803.**

**After Arrival 000.**
After Humans settled on Velen, three Empires were formed; The Empires of Duskite, loyal to Galvis. and Alar, who were exceptionally advanced at magic and polytheistic.

During the first period of settlement, Duskite controlled a majority of the land. Though this changed with King Adam I. He started the Godline lineage and was blessed by Selestis. After his blessing, King Adam I approached Solustar, the capital of Duskite, and took it, forming the city-state of Arduras. After this, Arduras grew in power and formed a rivalry with Duskite, starting a sort of "cold war".

During this period of centuries where Duskite and Arduras were rivals, Alar steadily expanded and grew in power. Though, seeing what happened with Solustar, and the rampant militarization of Arduras under the guidance of Selestis, Alar grew more creative with their magic. Tension started to grow between brew between Arduras and Alar.

Around the late 600's AA, Emperor Damianos is in power, and a very talented wizard. He does not submit to Arduras, and stands up against them, insulting them and moving his nation to action. Finally, after years of prep, Damianos claims that Selestis is a poor choice of god, did not create magic, and transforms himself into raw magical energy. This action both angers and scares Arduras, who then declare a full crusade against Alar. Damianos, realizing they were using religion to push the war, evaporates the main Church of Selestis in Arduras, blowing it to pieces. This causes a full war between Alar and Arduras. 

After years of war, and Selestis pushing far into Alarian territory, the Arduran Army makes it to the capital of Alar, Hali. When they are about to reach the Silver Palace and end the war, a large amount of fog pours over the landscape, and the Silver Palace disappears as if it was never there, and disappeared with no trace.

## The Murder of Ceres

The Feywild was created by Ceres, and Pan was created to help

The Prvni built big temples to act as gateways to the Feywild and respect Ceres

A man, Anorthosite, comes in and strolls into the Feywild

He shows up to the heart of the Feywild, and kills Ceres, but doesn't kill Pan

Leaves, returns to Velen, and is never seen again.

## Pan and Selestis take over.

After Ceres was killed, there was a gap of responsibility in the Pantheon. An agreement is made between Pan and Selestis to split the responsibilities, and give Selestis the domain of Life and Pan the domain of Nature. 

After this deal is made, Pan starts to become insane. The Fey Court starts to worry about Pan causing lots of destruction and murder, and lock him up in the heart of the Feywild, using their combined strength to maintain the Feywild in his place. For a while, things were tame. Then Hastur showed up.

Demonic and Galvonian in nature, and most likely summon in Velen or Selestia, Selestis came back to try and make sure Hastur is locked up. This worked well until Selestis started to lose grasp on his wide breadth of power, and losing his influence on the Feywild. Eventually Hastur's chains started to decay, and although not particularly powerful, it still created an issue. Once he broke out, Hastur started to create a domain for himself within the Feywild.

## The Disease

- Cough up blood. It doesn't even hurt that much, it's honestly more like vomiting blood. You are more prone to coughing up blood the normal painful way from getting hurt.
- You sometimes have dreams of a twitching bloody eye, you know the one. Sometimes you think people's actual eyes look like that, but it'll go away after a short time.
- The wound hurts interestingly. It is a mix between magical pain and a very physical one. Here's a good comparison. Imagine a giant wasp that injected a stinger into your back. There's some pain from the stinger and then there's this feeling of bad shit ("the venom of the stinger") flowing into your body
- A major effect of the illness is that your anointed powers have been stifled. Despite the fact you've probably killed a couple, you aren't getting benefits. At least that means your illness isn't really progressing much.
- The wound is a handprint I believe, just like the staff. The wound doesn't hurt a ton to the touch - it feels more internal. Touching it is like a burn mark - it's slightly raised and very red. There are vein-like things stretching out across most of your back and some of your arm (you choose, I forgot which side of your back the wound was on)
- Seems to be offset by her Anointment- this means that killing other Anointed can stave of the disease by offsetting the effects

## Vrazda
Its Complicated.
- see previous, also now making cyborgs to kill me?

Iselore and Vrazda's relationship is complicated, and Iselore still holds her love for him within her- the time they spent together was real and they genuinely wanted to escape the Feywild together.

#### The Beginning

Vrazda at first was genuinely a good person. Despite being a soldier of Arduras and the intolerance from King Adam II's reforms, He was very accepting of Iselore and showed more curiosity about the Star Druids than anything. They grew close quite quickly due to their shared bond;
- Their Familiars
- Magical Inclination
- The Fact that both of them were the only two Anointed on the Feywild to their knowledge
They both grew close over this short time period, until Vrazda was found out and arrested for hiding as a member of the army of a Fey Lord. After he was arrested and put into prison, Iselore became very worried and scared, immediately began to figure out how to get him out. But why? She most likely needed him to get out but why was she so worried?

Eventually Iselore worked up the strength, and managed to successfully lead a revolt in the town, leading to not only Vrazda being broken out of prison, but the two being cemented as well-like leaders of the town. This left Vrazda extremely grateful to Iselore, and their bond grew deeper. It also served as a mutual catalyst for their relationship. As they cemented their positions within the town, they both realized they had mutual feelings, and began to use their relationship as a further example of unity within their followers.

#### Escalation of Power

After cementing themselves within the town, they both came to an agreement that they needed more power and followers to properly escape the Feywild. The two began to introduce other neighboring towns to their religion - and promised protection and unity under powerful spellcaster if they became loyal followers. After they grew to expand and cover a few towns, other powerful people started to take notice of them. 

These people included some of the big figures, such as Kotos and Apharia. These people joined the cause for their own reasons and became sub-leaders, helping expand this "Church of the Light" out to even more towns. While this significantly expanded their power and control, it alerted several Fey Lords who were Not Happy. 

Though the battle was difficult, the two and their army of loyal followers managed to win the battle against the Fey Lords, and routing their armies. This lead to an open period, where Vrazda and Iselore quickly grabbed the open seats of power through assassination and targeted attacks, securing themselves a significant foothold within the Feywild. After the fighting, some important Fey figures were captured, and interrogated by Vrazda and Iselore. They learned some major things to aid in their escape, and then the Fey were summarily executed.

This battle led to Vrazda's biggest idea of how to escape yet- Take complete control of the Feywild, rebuild the destroyed temples, and reforge the gateway between the planes. Maybe even have enough power to cure Iselore's wound on her back. Throughout this process though, with all the violence, one thing started to emerge in Vrazda. He started to become obsessed with "healing" Iselore. That is how they met Molgast, but every attempt just didn't seem to work. Neither Vrazda nor Iselore knew anything about it, and Molgast couldn't figure it out.

#### Conquest (WHAT YOU DID WAS NOT NICE!!!)

The Conquest of the Feywild created lots of turmoil. The two used their military might and the devotion of their followers to effectively force other disorganized Fey Lords into submitting and joining their regime, being welcomed with open arms, or resisting and being crushed. While this proved to be effective, and growing in effectiveness exponentially as their influence grew, it started to weigh down on the leaders, especially Vrazda and Iselore, stuck with the difficulty of managing the people under their rule and knowing that to an extent - the unwanted persecution they both suffered under had to be used to accomplish their goals. Especially Vrazda began to show signs of degradation on his psyche.

One day, after about 2 years of the conquest, Vrazda confided in Iselore that the longer they spent in the Feywild and the more they had to fight and conquer, the more he began to feel inhuman.

## Allies

- **Morsus** - skeleton man and director of the SAS, and the principal of Silocasm. Armide gave a lot of information to him about the Feywild, hopefully in return for him to trust her and owe her something in the future.
- **The Circle of Stars**(?) - No clue where any of them are.
- **Artix** - bonded over their shared feelings of loss. Armide is searching for connection through her deluded self-centeredness and may try and find that in him. 

## Enemies

- **Hastur** - The current demonic ruler of the Feywild.
- **The Bloodstar** - The man who put her into her current condition, she wants a cure and revenge, maybe even obliteration of the Sanguine Creed.
- **Scary TV Head guy** - Uh. What. The. Fuck.

## Former allies and enemies

- **Apharia** - An ally of you and Vrazda. He was a human that had been trapped in the Feywild for a while. Pretty old guy at that point. However, he was a talented alchemist that was very helpful early on. Unfortunately, you had an early encounter with a fey lord known as the Scarlet Prince. As punishment for Apharia seeking his help, Apharia lost all of his limbs and his torso. His head was placed out in the burning desert to suffer for eternity.

- **Tobalt** - An Anointed who crossed your paths part way through your journey. Unlike the few others you found who were allied, Tobalt took it upon himself to fight you guys and try to take your power. He was a brutal barbarian, but you guys took him down eventually. You ended up receiving his power which helped stave away your illness. Vrazda tried to figure out what the deal with the Anointed was by comparing his corpse to Alexis', but there was no real similarity aside from their once glowing eyes. He separated the eyes from the bodies in case any funky shit happened, then he probably threw out the corpses. Guess I lied, one of these new guys died.
- Got turned into a cyborg reani-man? who the fuck is making these and why Silocasm of all places to drop them?
- Why was it so powerful and what was the point of the Crystals?
- How did they get Tobalt's body?

- **June** - Don't worry, she didn't die. She was an early ally that was once a druid of Pan. She probably had some interesting conversations with you. Her Pan worship made a druid circle you guys encountered very angry. You had to flee at this point - weren't strong enough at this point in your campaign. You later found her, but as punishment for her worship she was stretched out into a giant tarp made of skin that was facing the sun until she boiled.

- **Kotos** - Vrazda's earliest ally. Big human guy, Vrazda showed up in a panic to the Feywild and Kotos agreed to fill Vrazda in on stuff in exchange for Vrazda helping Kotos (he was on the other side of the army Vrazda basically spawned in on lol). He would be a helpful ally for a while. When Vrazda left, his closest allies aside from you kind of all split up with their little close circles as the King in Yellow claimed the territories. Never saw exactly what happened, but it sounded like he got impaled by a ton of spears after trying to conquer some Fey. 
![[Pasted image 20250410170639.png]]

- **Officer Rotforth** - Werewolf who was kind of a douche. Vrazda actually got crucified before meeting you when the army found out that he was not who he claimed to be. Under this officer's order's, Vrazda was strung out on a cross in a storm for 3 days. When he didn't die, he got brought back down and everyone kind of just accepted he was a weird guy...except Officer Rotforth. Rotforth was the first person Vrazda killed in the Feywild - Vrazda slit his throat before his eventual escape. 

- **Alexis** - Another Anointed you guys found. She was close to you two for a while - a rogue back when she lived in Velen. However, as things got more and more intense, she tried to assassinate Vrazda after claiming the Light she saw told her to. This was the first person Vrazda killed from Velen outside of war.

- **Molgast** - very old human who got trapped in the Feywild very long ago He ended up helping you guys out for a while (including helping you kill that Fey Lord) until it came to Vrazda's attention that Molgast ended up in the Feywild for a very particular reason 
	- Molgast was a horrible criminal in the large, fabled City of Pillars. He had been creating fungal parasites in an attempt to overthrow the government. Shockingly enough, the hosts were not willing. So imagine the Last of Us but very targetted and with a small group. The Nameless Sultan is very powerful and apparently banished him himself
