Dynamo (Copper brown, Cyan, Silver), (also referred to as “gennies” by the other gangs) is the least wealthy of the big three due to their constant skirmishes with the Coalpowders, but this doesn't mean they aren't powerful. The Dynamos have strict rules against substances being used within their ranks, and have developed a strict and disciplined almost militaristic control over their staked territory over the decades. They are superior to the Coalpowders and even the Raiders in combat, but lose out due to the Coalpowders wealth and the Raiders guerilla tactics. The Dynamos leader is Bulwark, an awakened automaton who was created by the deceased Dr. Terra g’Nafi.
