The Ukucha are a race of rat-like people who live primarily in Zenka, but are revered inside of Asyria for being kin of the Great Storm, Ederna.

Ukucha are quick on their feet and surprisingly intelligent, they live shorter lives than humans but are thought to be direct kin of the chaotic energy of Ederna, the Eternal Storm. Sharing origin with Ederna, the Ukucha are a chaotic people, and are impulsive, which earns them a poor reputation outside of Zenka and Asyria. The Ukuchas history also inclines them to help others, even those of different races. Ukucha may impulsively steal from a shop one day, then help that same shop owner rebuild after a big storm.
