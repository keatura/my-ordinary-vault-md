Threski is a Gigantic almost Wyvern-like creature, that appears to be the hybrid of a Japanese Ibis, a Crocodile, and an amalgam of human flesh. It stands on four legs, but can hunch back on its taloned feet to make attacks with it's claws. It has a fairly thin body, with a long crocodile tail covering in hardened feathers. The front arms have giant membranes of human skin, and are also covered in these armored feathers. It's head is long and reserves most of the features of the Ibis it is based on, though the long beak is widened and has the sharp teeth of a Crocodile.

#### Preparation

>You all find yourselves in the workshop and headquarters, the Hunter Org ECLIPSE. After just recently acquiring 100lbs of Tannerite via Legal Means and the help of a large military truck, a somber tone hangs in the air with the threat of an attack from a supposed "large flesh monster with spikes for hands".

Give them time to prepare, but dont let them finish. If one of them leaves to go get more supplies, Natalie shows up. The cannon should get finished, but it should be sudden when Threski crashes through the roof of the shop.

A few minutes before the impact on the shop, have a Japanese Ibis fly into the shop. (maybe land in/on jessie)



#### Skynyrd dies

> As you are starting to finish your preparations, you heard a faint sound.
> 	A distant sound of air moving, seemingly like large wings flapping through the air.
> Then they grow louder.
> And louder.
> Until suddenly- a loud *CRASH* and the metal roof of the workshop gains a huge, roughly 15-foot radius imprint, then literally *tears* it open, with the shrieking of protest from the sheets ringing painfully in your ears, and through comes this giant bird-crocodile-creature.
> You look down, and directly under it you see Skynyrd, who was just getting out of one of his truck and he freezes, looks up, his eyes fill with absolute, pure terror.
> 
> And you watch, seemingly in slow motion, as this massive arm comes down on top of Skynyrd, and crushing him under the weight of the creature and flattening his truck like a pancake. Realizing his situation, Skynyrd reaches for the gun he dropped, screaming
> "H-H-HELP PLEASE DEAR MOTHER OF GO-"
> And this beast puts it's full weight down on him, and Skynyrd.. like. Explodes? Blood and gore splatter the ground around the shop, while the car alarm from the truck is going off, being loudly reverberated around the shop. all of you notice a figure slip off it's back and down onto the floor next to the beast.
> 
> As she jumps down, and regains her footing, she looks down at this man who was crushed, frowning. she points to him, and seeming to just *appear* in front of her is this 6'3", bald, dark skinned man, (describe Murphy) holding a fucking longsword with a huge knife on his belt. This man picks up Skynyrd's head, and chucks it into this gigantic monstrosities' mouth, which it grabs in it's mouth swallows it whole.
