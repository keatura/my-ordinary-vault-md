## Session Description

Exposition? all of them crammed into the back seat of a truck.

Exposition from [[James Clark]], the leader of the [[ECLIPSE]] org in the city.

One of the Gangrel comes back and jumps them, but he’s injured and runs away if they fight back too much.

introduce the [[Ashwood Abbey]] cell that’s currently taking a tourist visit through Detroit, due to word of the Sabbat invasion. The leader of the cell wants to torture some vampires for fun.

## ECLIPSE Interrogation pt.2
The Cell finds themselves in the back of a black truck, handcuffed and being taken somewhere.

Resume from them getting handcuffed, that part was rushed last session and poorly done. Give the players freedom.
#### Getting to the Warehouse

>The Atmosphere inside of the truck in awkward, you three not quite fitting comfortably next to each other, your hands pressing into the seat behind you. The two men in the row in front of you don't say anything, this same grizzled looking man that seemed to be their leader looking over papers and occasionally signaling on radio to the other truck behind you. Sitting in one of the cupholders in the front is a small pistol, seemingly at arms reach. Jessie, you come to from your injuries with this pain like you have never felt in your shoulder before. 

if they don't try and talk to the other two people in the car, they are brought to what seems to be an abandoned car shop about 10 minutes away from the mall, the ECLIPSE HQ. If they ask about anything, they are reassured that if they comply, everything will be explained once they get somewhere safe.

>As you pull into the front of this red brick building, through this chain-link fence that has had wood planks set up on the inside of it, one of the garage doors open, you stop, and two guys from the other truck come up to the doors and pull you three out. The trucks pull into the garage, and these two same guys with guns stand you up one at a time, patting you down. Wolfie, your dog jumps out the back of the truck.

>The guy whos not patting you three down looks at all of you, "Whatever one of you's dog that is, you better fuckin' control it. I seen enough violence tonight."

After everyone is finished getting pat down, they are brought inside through this big garage. 

The other truck has the vampires thrown into the trunk, if the players look they see a couple guys pulling four bodies out of the bed, 3 of them have stakes and one of them just gets left out in the parking lot.

#### Inside the HQ
> Filled with various cars and other vehicles along with other people with guns, you hear the sounds of some air tools over muffled swearing as you are lead into this office towards the back of the shop.

>As you enter this office room at the back of the shop, you see about 30 chairs lined up in front of a projector screen, with a office table at the back. You get sat down in the front row of these chairs, and this same grizzled man pulls a chair around and sits down in it facing towards you. One of your escorts takes out a pair of dykes and cuts your zip-cuffs.

> This middle-aged looking man, kind of scruffy looking with stubble and stress lines all over his face pulls out a box of cigarettes, takes one, thinks for a second, and offers some to you. "Look, I'm not asking why you were there, but what did you think to accomplish following five guys into an abandoned mall in the middle of the night. And you-"

He turns to look at Nikita.

> "We need you to not say anything about this, to anyone. I'm not gonna threaten you here, but ya cant trust any of your higher-ups. I'm sure all y'all have.. a lot of questions, but first of all, lets clear things up. We're not gonna kill you, but your lives will change. Your friends, coworkers, that weird guy on the end of the street, you'll start to see weird things around. Unexplainable things. What you all saw in the mall tonight, were Vampires. "Blankbodies", we call em. they're real, as real werewolves and ghosts. They kinda... run things 'round here, y'see. Those guys you saw inside the Mall earlier? they were settin' up there, from the other two we found, probably lickin' their wounds somewhere safe. All of y'all are lucky. Real lucky. Seems like the Newblood that got you-"

He points at Jessie

>"Seemed like a real freak, wanted more than just your blood. Inhuman, honestly. Any pers- ***Thing.*** that feeds on us, deserves to be staked and left for the sun."

Answer any questions, and just give some exposition to explain stuff. If asked, or towards the end of the conversation, James hands tells everyone his phone number. After he talks for long enough and starts to trust them, they are given their belongings back. 

James knows about the Masquerade, but not about the Sabbat or Camarilla. He does know there's some kind of Holy War / Invasion happening in Detroit currently, and warns the players to be safe due to the large amount of Vampire activity. He does know about Vampire Ghouls, and if asked why they shouldn't trust anyone, he explains what a Ghoul is. He also explains what a ghoul is when he tells them about the Masquerade and what to do as to not breach it. 

James should also encourage the players to band together, even if its not working for them.

> "Listen, you all together just got yourselves into some deep shit. And if I were you, I wouldn't necessarily like your current captors. I get it. Being held at gunpoint and brought places isn't fun, and I get that. But at least you three need to work together. I'm not sure what your relations were before this but its all your jobs to keep each other alive now. No point in resisting those in control if you end up dead."

If Wolfie asks about what happened at the apartment block, say:

> James looks at you, and thinks for a second.
> "Hmm.. does sound familiar."
> Then you see his expression darkens a little bit.
> "Do **not** look into it kid. There's many a great things you can do if you wanna fight back against the supernaturals, but I assure you, nothing good will come of this."

He stands firm on this point of making sure Wolfie doesn't look into it.

If Nikita asks about the murder nearby:

> "Yeah, they are probably related. One of em was fairly freshly fed looked like, and that poor bastard probably just ended up in the wrong place, at the wrong time. Fuckin' monsters don't have any self-respect."

If asked, James says the captured vampires are going to be interrogated then left for the sun. The oldest one is being shipped to main HQ for research.

After all the talking is done, figure out how to get everybody back to where they need to be. It's probably about 3am at this point.

## Another Encounter
As Nikita heads back to the parking lot to retrieve her cruiser, she once again comes face to face with one of the Gangrel.

#### If Nikita goes by herself
If Nikita goes by herself, (unlikely), she would have to get a taxi, in which case the same thing happens as below, but with a random guy. If she takes a bus, or some other means, she enters the parking lot by herself. As she walks towards her cruiser, she makes a **difficulty 4 Wits + Awareness** check. If she succeeds she sees the Gangrel vampire, [[Darnell Watson]]. He attempts to tackle her. 

#### If Nikita gets help from ECLIPSE
If Nikita asks for a ride to the lot to pick up her cruiser, she is driven there without much complaint. As Nikita enters the lot, she makes a **difficulty 4 Wits + Awareness** check. If she succeeds, she sees the Gangrel vampire, [[Darnell Watson]] lying in wait. He still does the same action as if she didn't see him, but Nikita gets to react before the driver is killed. If she doesn't, the Gangrel approaches and stealthily and kills the ECLIPSE member driving her. He breaks the window, grabs the hunter by his neck and pulls him out, crushing his neck. He then attempts to tackle Nikita.

#### Darnell
Darnell is a 9th generation Gangrel, who was born in LA but Embraced in Detroit by a superior on a work trip, as he was an electrician. He has since rebelled against the Camarilla after his best friend was killed by the Camarilla in LA as a punishment for him breaking the Masquerade, even though he had not been informed of the rules yet. He returned to Detroit afterwards to seek revenge on his Sire, and was pulled into the Sabbat after a stroke of luck allowed him to Diablerize his Sire, turning him to a 9th generation.

Whether he tackles Nikita or not, Darnell wants to know where the rest of his pack went. His Vinculum binds him to care about them, and while he has not felt it shatter yet, he does wish the best for the closest thing he had to a family. Luckily, he didn't see Nikita kill Richard and he doesn't want the problems that come with killing an officer (assuming the ECLIPSE hunters killed him.), but he does want at least some information from her. While he doesn't know about ECLIPSE as an organization, he hates the hunters for killing his family. He wants to know:
- Where they came from
- Why they hunted them
- What they are doing with the staked ones
- If he tackled Nikita, he takes 2 level of blood, dealing 1 level of aggravated damage to Nikita. She feels woozy from the blood loss after this, and he disappears.
- If he didn't tackle Nikita, he backs away slowly, then takes whatever car she took there. If she took a bus or got there by some other means, he literally just runs off lmfao.
