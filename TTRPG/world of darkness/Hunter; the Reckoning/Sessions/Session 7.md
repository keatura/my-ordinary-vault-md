## Session Description

Get everyone situated, and a quick brief on the State of the City.
-The Vampire war of dominance has escalated without many results, but gang violence and people moving on the streets at night is extremely common.
-The Police Department has become completely useless, due to it being extremely dangerous to patrol areas of high activity, though for some reasons nothing like the national guard has been called.
-People have started forming militia groups to protect themselves and their communities
-The City is basically closed off to the outside world - people are checked on the way out and basically no one can or wants to go in or out
-The Yellow Gang is doing Something

## The Letters
The Party in a moment of silence gets some letters from a mysterious exterior faction...

Opening summary of the state of things:

> [!note]
> It has been roughly a year since the attack by Jessie's sister and her horrific amalgamation. In this time, you all have successfully managed to lie low while continuing your life as "normal", or as normal as it can be anymore. Though it may provide some insight into why the city is the way it is.
> 
> **Nikita**, what you always thought were just suspicious teens doing some petty crime in the night, or gang members disputing over territory, you are now starting to realize may be subject to something darker, and more sinister.
>  
> **Wolfie**, while luckily you had never been in a direct confrontation with the supernatural during your delinquent years, you are starting to realize that there was more to some of the goings on, and there is *definitely* more to the massacre of your family.
> 
> **Jessie**, after the attack by and subsequent death of your sister, and all that led up to that and followed afterwards has forcefully opened your eyes the the raw cruelty of the world around you, though it may have brought some closure.

#### Opening Scene
Open with all three of the people sitting in a fast food place. It's quiet, only a couple employees behind the counter and some other people silently eating their food. There's a newspaper on the table from before they sat down. On the front headline, it reads:
**MAN LOST HIS EYE IN ATTACK ON WEST SIDE**
It reads about how a man named Christian Gomez was attacked by some unidentified person at Lapeer Park while walking home late at night. Though in the scuffle, he only lost his eye, as in it was completely removed from the socket. Just Gone. He doesnt have any other injuries. He reports that he was "attacked, and knocked out quickly, and he woke up missing the eye and in pain."

- it's currently evening (like 7pm) and around December.
- it's below freezing outside and there is fresh snow falling, about an inch or two on the ground.
- Any driving done is done slowly or you must make a check to not crash.
