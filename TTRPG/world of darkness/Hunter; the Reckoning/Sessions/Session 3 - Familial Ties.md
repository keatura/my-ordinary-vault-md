## Session Description

Jessie deals with his sister trying to convince him to become a vampire. 
Nikita and Wolfie begin an awkward relationship between police officer and gang member.

## Apartments

Jessie comes home from his encounter at he mall, and with [[ECLIPSE]], but he cannot sleep yet. His sister, [[Natalie Park]] followed him to [[Detroit]], hoping to bring him home to [[New York City]], and [[The Aitvara]], for Embrace. 

#### Jessie fucking dies?

Jessie walks back into Allen's apartment, above his shop. Sitting at the dining table inside, is his sister, Natalie. Allen seems unaffected by her presence, seemingly zoned out. He has been charmed by Natalie, who also drank from him to satiate her hunger after travelling to Detroit.

Natalie is not happy in Detroit, and wants to leave back to NYC and the security of The Aitvara's lair as soon as possible. She has not introduced herself to the Camarilla in Detroit, and simply wants to take Jessie and leave, whether forcefully or no.

> As you enter your uncles apartment, the dirty floor and small main area, with the kitchen and dining room combined, and a TV playing some movie in the other room. As your eyes dart around, Jessie, you see your uncle sitting at the dining room table, dazed, and your eyes fall onto two red pinpricks. Staking your soul through the darkness, these eyes, so familiar to you. The eyes that started everything these past couple days. Your sister, sitting at the table. 

> "Jessie? Where have you been?!?. I saw you leave so suddenly, I followed you here to bring you home. You need to come home Jessie, we are all so worried about you, especially me."

Natalie wants to bring Jessie back to NYC, and will give him answers if necessary, but only to further her goal of bringing him back to NYC to be embraced. She will not tell him about anything related to Kindred or their society unless he mentions something first. Natalie's curse causes her to be repelled by the cross necklace Jessie wears, as it protects him with the literal power of an angel. If she has to, she will attempt to Dominate him to will him to come with her. She fully believes that the Embrace is what's best for Jessie, and her love for the Aitvara 

## The Next Day
As Nikita and Wolfie wake up after a very long day, they have to deal with Wolfie's past.

#### A Rival Gang
Wolfie's neighborhood is located a couple blocks away from a medium-sized gang based out of a neighborhood, who all wear yellow bandannas. If Wolfie heads back to her neighborhood she starts to see members of this gang looking like they are patrolling the streets. While they don't look outwardly hostile, they give off a "don't fuck with us" vibe, and most keep their hands in their pockets and look confident. 

Wolfie isn't well known enough for the randoms to recognize her, but if she approaches one of the gangs, they will claim that the neighborhood is their territory now. A new "Boss" ([[Arsenal]]) has put himself in charge, and the money has been rolling in. 

#### A Gang of Magic
If they look in further, there's a few things they can find out.

While talking to this gang that they approached, if they ask who this boss is, make a **Difficulty 3 Manipulation + Persuasion roll**. **The roll automatically fails if Nikita is wearing her uniform**. If it fails, they refuse to provide any information more than that he's a new leader for them, and he has money. If it succeeds, they tell them (if Nikita isn't wearing uniform).

uh
figure something out lmfao
