## Chapter 1 - [[Jessie Park]]
```
We begin about a week before our story, November 2nd. Your view pans from overlooking Detroit, down to the highway, onto a bus heading into the city. It stops looking out the window of a bus. The gray, overcast skyline Detroit, threatening rain. The damp, earthy smell of petrichor seeps into the bus through what must be minute cracks in the seal of the window, a circle of condensation foorming with each breath. 

As the bus approaches the city, and the buildings grow taller as they start to loom over you, the squeal of the brakes and the “pssh” of air as the bus comes to a stop. Jessie, you step out of the bus, in the center of Detroit.
```

Jessie is riding into [[Detroit]] on a bus.
Jessie gets dropped off in the city center, allow him to really do whatever he wants, till he gets to the [[Detroit Public Library]].

## Chapter 2 - [[Wolfie]]
open up in a catholic church. 
The pastors name is Charlie
Wolfie gets to the library and open up a scene with both Wolfie and Jessie in it
skip forward a week 

## Chapter 3 - [[Nikita]]
- sitting in her cruiser munching on subway like the RE2 truck driver, reading a magazine about shotguns, sees m1014 in the magazine.
open with Nikita waking up to a call from her boss, calling her to a scene

the murder was done by a vampire, who afterwards retreated to his hideout in the mall, with the rest of his pack.

the body was drained of blood first, but was punched afterwards to make it look like just a normal murder. the bite wounds on the neck were licked closed and not noticeable, seems like the exploded head just caused the blood to pour out onto the concrete.
Intelligence + Medicine difficulty 3 to see if the blood on floor vs the body doesn't match up
- head looks like it was blown off by a shotgun, it was eaten by one of the Gangrel 
## Chapter 4 - The Mall
The [[Great Lakes Crossing Mall]] is an outlet mall on the outskirts of Detroit, which was abandoned after several murders and missing persons cases appeared in the area. It's gigantic, half-a-mile long mega mall, covered in scaffolding and filled with half-built stores.

![[Pasted image 20250122173306.png]]

#### Getting to the Mall
If the players investigate further into the Malls’ history:
```
The Great Lakes Crossing Mall was a planned mega mall, under construction for the suburbs on the outskirts of the city, that was abandoned mid-construction and now stands dilapidated and unused.

On a difficulty 1 Intelligence+Investigation roll, they find out that the construction was cancelled after a surge of missing persons cases started popping up in the area. The construction company left before any more of their workers got hurt, after three went missing in a short period. 
```
Jessie & Wolfie are heading to the mall to investigate missing persons
check to see how they get there, as it is a good distance away
by the time they get there, it should be around midnight

#### Outside the Mall
As they investigate around the Mall, they see a group of three figures, two of which look sort of hunchbacked.

On a difficulty 3 Wits+Awareness, they can see that the “hunchbacks” are actually 2 other people being carried hurriedly into the mall. 

#### First Encounters
then, the mall itself:

``` 
In front of you stands a large, imposing structure, the Great Lakes Crossing Mall. Spanning about half a mile in length and a quarter mile in width, with towering walls, looming over you in the night. Due to its abandoned status, the mall is pitch black, not even a single light on inside.

The doors in front of you are in this gigantic framed glass entrance, with 8 doors. A lot of the glass stands broken or gone, most likely due to vandalism or some other reason. Graffiti and other tags cover the walls as far as you can see, and the floor of the mall extends as far as you can see into the darkness.
```

The vampires notice anyone that enters, and stalk them, not attacking until they get close to their two wounded.

The vampires are staying inside the Panera's kitchen in the food court, with the two injured ones inside the kitchen and the others patrolling throughout the mall.

#### FIGHT!!
idk. make them fight a vampire, maybe like a Gangrel or something. he's newly turned, probably doesn't know how to use disciplines yet. his buddies do though
Nikita probably gets jumped by the other 2 vamps before she can one-shot the newbie

```
Pg 168-169 for vampire stats
HP 7 WP 4
General Difficulty: 5/2
Physical 6, Social 3, Mental 5
Exceptional Dice Pools
Brawl 8 (fistfighting), Athletics 9 (tossing prey around), Animal Ken 7 (speaking with coyotes), Stealth 7 (moving silently)

try and 3-and-done the encounter, with Jessie and Wolfie being captured so they can be fed to the wounded two to help them not enter torpor.

The Sabbat gang is comprised of 5 Gangrel members, Two of them are the "Leaders", the lowest generations in the gang. 

The youngest doesnt have any skill in disciplines yet, except a base level of Protean and Fortitude, giving him glowing red eyes to freak out Jessie and general Gangrel tankiness.

The other two able-bodied Gangrel are older, and should have some more dice to boot (+1). similar levels of discipline, but with a point of Potence, allowing them to throw the Hunters like ragdolls

John (youngest), Richard, Jesus.
```

#### ECLIPSE Intervention
Whether the fight goes good or bad (probably bad), eventually the rest of the gang of vampires shows up to reinforce their buddy, and as they are getting ready to enjoy themselves a nice fresh meal, an ECLIPSE cell shows up and like. shoots the vampires or something crazy, then forces the players to come with them, at gunpoint if they have to.
the hunters have those animal control wire collar things to control a vampires head if they catch it and long spear like stakes

## Chapter 5 - ECLIPSE Interrogation.
The players are taken back to a warehouse that is fairly close to the Mall. They wake tied up, but not at gunpoint, each sitting on a chair in the room.
#### The Warehouse
The party wakes up in a dimly lit warehouse room, surrounded by 5 people, one sitting on a chair across the room and 4 others with guns standing defense, two black trucks that look to have been hastily pulled into the warehouse behind them.

start with;
```
"Look, I'm not asking why you were there, but what did you think to accomplish following 5 guys into an abandoned mall in the middle of the night. "
```
