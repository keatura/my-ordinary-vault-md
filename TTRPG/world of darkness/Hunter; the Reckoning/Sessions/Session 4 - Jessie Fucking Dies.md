## Session Description

Nikita does research and Jessie Fucking Dies Part 4.

## The Autopsy
Nikita examines a dead body

#### A Dead Man
The body on the table is a young man, probably late teens to early 20's though it's hard to tell with exploded head. The body has a yellow bandanna in the one of the back pockets, and is otherwise wearing nothing special, with a gray sweatshirt and black ripped jeans. The body contains no bullets, fragments, or buckshot.

## Jessie Fucking Dies
Nosferatu Bodyguard:
A hulking man, at least 6'3" in a nothing but a wife beater and worn light blue jeans, with gray-blue skin and bulging sickly black veins running all over his body. His face is shaven and disformed, with wrinkles and old scars covering his face, with no hair to cover any of it. On his plain brown belt, he has a nice leather sheath with a large bowie knife on it.
do a NYC accent, his name is Murphy

Jessie plans for his second meeting with his sister

#### The Apartment
When Jessie returns to the apartment, he sees a note on the door:

> Hey Jessie,
> I'm gonna be out for tonight, door's unlocked but make sure you lock it when you come inside. There's some leftovers in the fridge, and whatever you can scrounge up in the cupboards. Don't trash the place while I'm out.
> Your Uncle.

Sitting at the table in the same spot she was last time is Natalie, and while invisible, Her Nosferatu bodyguard thrall is invisible standing next to the door. 

Natalie dominated Allen to go out and not return until the morning.
