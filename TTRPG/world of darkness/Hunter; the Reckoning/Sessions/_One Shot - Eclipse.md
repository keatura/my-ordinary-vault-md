## Session Description

A group of [[ECLIPSE]] [[Hunters]] is hunting for a group of vampires who have been causing trouble in the area. In order to do this, they have gotten insight that one of the potential vamps is sneaking into a party of important people and need to figure who the undead one is and “remove” them. The brief from their higher-up’s is that the mansion the party is taking place in will be secured from the outside and no one will be getting in or out until the night ends or the vampire is found, and promptly taken care of. 

>[!note]
> - The night should be split up into 3 major chapters, Evening, Midnight, and Dawn.
> - Each chapter should have some major events happen, or reveal some major clues.
> - Try to not kill characters until Dawn.
> - The players get in under the guise of waiting staff and security, which gives them access to a staff room
> - Give the players the ability to hide one or two small items in their uniforms. 

## The Lead-up
Choose a fast food place, the Cell is eating. They get a call from their [[Manager]], telling them that they need to report to HQ for a mission briefing.
#### The Food
- choose a fast food place, let the players build the scene
- figure out who has the highest leadership skill, they get a call from their [[Manager]]

> Alright —-, listen up. Managements got a new job for y’all, some kinda party for the wealthy. Remember that blank-body we’ve been trackin’ for the past 2 months? We got word that he’s gonna be makin’ an appearance there. I can’t tell you the rest over the phone, but this looks to be the only shot we got at getting this guy. Get your asses to headquarters.

#### Briefing
- Detroit’s ECLIPSE HQ is an old, grungy, run down mechanics’ shop on the outskirts of the city. Its prevalent feature is the two bay doors and garages where ECLIPSE stores their fleet vehicles for transport. There is two guys standing outside of the main door, and while they don’t look armed, the players would know they have pistols, and there’s more guys inside ready to come out if needed. 
- Their manager is literally in the managers office of the shop. The interior of it has been rearranged to look like a military briefing room. Several rows of seats are lined up in front of a whiteboard with a projector being displayed onto it.
- The projector is displaying a map of a fairly large house.
- The manager is sitting at his desk in the corner of the room, looking over recent reports from other Cells. 
- The managers name is Mason Bixley
- he’s 37

> Now as you should all know by now, We’ve got an opening to take down this Blank we’ve been hunting for a couple months now. About a week from now, he decided to show his ugly mug at this party in Bloomfield Hills. Some rich old-money baby is hosting a party for his buddies in the city, and I guess our quarry wormed his way in. 
> 
> Now, if this shit was easy, we would have a name and description, but… certain circumstances prevent this. We have no clue what he is going to look like at this party, or what name he is going to go by either. Now of course, we know a couple things. He’s an “Elder” as they call em in Kindred society. He’s old. Old as fuck. He’s probably not familiar with modern electronics, and probably hates modern music as well, as the grumpy old bastards tend to. Other than that, he’s tall, and the most damning, he’s new. He probably won’t know many people there, so be suspicious of anyone trying’ to make acquaintances. Most important of all, this one’s been a thorn in our side for a while now, he’s not for the labs. Send ‘im to hell. 
> 
> Lastly, your side of the party. We managed to get you in as new hires for the wait staff at this guys mansion, cost me looootsa money to bribe him to let us do what we want. Be polite, and stay on your A-game, he’s expecting you to have experience with this type of shit already. Meet me at the trucks in 30 minutes, and i’ll take y’all to buy fancy new tailored suits just for the occasion, you better appreciate it. Any questions?

- The "certain circumstances" is the last cell that made an attempt on the vampire was wiped out, but it was in less favorable conditions.
#### Preparations 
- The players go out and get some suits tailored to them, then let them decide what gear they want to bring to the party, let them have a few items hidden inside their suits and some larger items brought in beforehand. 

## Evening
After a long ride to the house, you pass through a large gate into this beautiful garden of flowers and freshly trimmed and shaped bushes, following this roundabout driveway, perfectly framing a gigantic mansion, with beams breaking up the large flat white walls, looking almost medieval. This house has an almost looming presence, intimidating yet beautiful. You see a chauffeur calling to you to drop the truck off.
