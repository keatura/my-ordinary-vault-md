## Session Description

Hoptal + Exploration
Jessie gets a note?
lay off the danger, but it should still be there.

## Hoptal
```
A somber feeling hangs over the truck you two are riding in, as the cold, howling wind beats against the canvas roof. In the center row, Lynyrd is messily tending to some wounded people with bandages, a bit of blood leaking into a pool on the floor. No one is speaking, and the sound of the engine of the truck and the wind passing by is occasionally drowned out by pained screaming and moans as these few injured survivors lie. Most of the people in the truck are injured in some way, but few with more major injuries survived. Up at the front of the bed is a pile covered in blood-soaked canvas.
```

Beatrice is driving the truck to an Urgent Care.
James is missing an arm.

After Lynyrd finishes bandaging people to the best of his ability he brings up evading the police:
- if anyone asks, the Workshop ECLIPSE was using was registered as a gun club, called the "North Detroit Firearm Preservation Society"
- 

**Important NPC's:**
- Urgent Care Receptionist, Clara Holmes (short, bags under her eyes and tired, has a kinda droopy face)
- Nurse, William Davis (tall and thin with brown hair in a mullet, gives off the aura of a Vanilla Ice fan)



#### Nikita fakes a car crash.
- Nikita's car is crashed right outside of the ECLIPSE HQ, which is now of fire
- She is brought to the same ER as all the hunters
- When she wakes up 

## Everyone gets questioned by the Police.
[[Harris Flores]] comes into Nikita's hospital room to talk to her about the attack and her being outside of it.

#### Nikita
Her boss comes in to ask her about why she was there.
- What were you looking into?
- Why were you plainclothes?
- How did you crash/ what cause you to crash?
If Nikita says something weird he will press certain matters
He also should warn her that she only has a couple days PTO as the Homicide Department has been pretty understaffed, and that she needs to get out quickly.

#### Other cops come a-lookin
- Vanessa Bailey
- Benjamin Turner
