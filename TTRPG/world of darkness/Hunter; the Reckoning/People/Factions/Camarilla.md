Generally speaking, as far as the single city is concerned:

- The Prince is at the top and the Seneschal just below him.

- Then there are the Primogens, but Primogens can be extremely influential and occasionally even surpass the Prince. The Council of the Primogens as a whole usually has enough power to depose or make a Prince, but even there it all depends on how much power the Prince holds if compared to them; Mithras or Vitel were unchallengeable, Kevin of Chicago has a much weaker hold over his rule and can only stay on top because he's exceptional at mediating between the primogens, and any Prince in Prague is less influential than clan Tremere so they can't really do whatever they want.

- The Whips are servants of a specific Primogen and basically halfway between messengers and naggers that make sure people behave as their Primogen wants. It's kinda the same role that Frank Underwood has at the beginning of House of Cards- he makes sure the whole clan stays in line and moves as one.

- Then we have the Sheriff. Scourges and Hounds are behind him and roughly on the same level, but even here it depends a bit on who is who. I.e., London has four Sheriffs because it's an extremely large city, were it to be just one Scourge it would be certainly more influential than a single Sheriff, although more limited in scope.

- The Keeper of the Elysium is surely below the Sheriff, but on a different branch; the Sheriff will have to provide security when the Keeper asks, though, or risk repercussions for leaving the Elysium unsafe.

- Harpies are not an official role in the CWoD but, generally speaking, they are masters of the Elysia and all their influence comes from how they behave there. They can easily get more influential and important then the Sheriff, even if they don't really have any actual invested power. In V5 they're called Heralds and they are agents of the Prince, and in this incarnation I'd say they are pretty low rank overall (but still above Whips and Hounds).
