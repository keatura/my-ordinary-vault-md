**Микита Кирилівка Ломаченко (Nikita Kyrylivna Lomachenko)** is a Detective from [[Boston]], Who currently lives in [[Detroit]] and is currently a Detective in the [[Detroit Police Department|D.P.D]] [[Homicide Department]]. In 1996, Nikita was investigating a case, and ended up in a abandoned apartment with another officer, by the name of Jason Hallaway.
