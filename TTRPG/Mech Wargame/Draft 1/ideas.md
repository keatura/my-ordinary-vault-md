## The Purpose of these rules.
The Purpose of this ruleset is to provide a fast-paced and tactically deep high-mobility war game of mech on mech action.

## The Rules

### Initiative
Initiative is rolled on **2d6**, subtracting the number of mechs in your list from the roll. This can reduce the end number on your roll into the negatives for the purpose of deciding who wins the **Initiative Roll**.

### Activation Order
This game is played with a alternating activation order, where each player takes a turn spending **one Energy Dice** on **all of their mechs**, until both players have no more dice. The loser of the **Initiative Roll** moves first.
