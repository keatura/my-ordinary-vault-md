ok i know im supposed to be asleep but i just had an idea i need to write down table top mech game d6 based with a dice pool size determined by your equipment spend dice from your pool to do stuff like dash and move and shoot have limits on amounts of dice you can spend per turn based on equipment (only 2 boosts per turn or only 3 dice spent on a weapon per attack) not sure how calculating a “to-hit” would work but 

armor and defense should be separated maybe works similarly to lancer for health and stuff idfk

would play similarly to armored core or something with lots of movement and direction switching

no opportunity attacks etc   

maybe have attacks auto hit and have defender have to spend leftover dice in their pool to dodge
probably would be hex grid but also gridless would work
