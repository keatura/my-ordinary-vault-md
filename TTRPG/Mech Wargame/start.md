ok i know im supposed to be asleep but i just had an idea i need to write down table top mech game d6 based with a dice pool size determined by your equipment spend dice from your pool to do stuff like dash and move and shoot have limits on amounts of dice you can spend per turn based on equipment (only 2 boosts per turn or only 3 dice spent on a weapon per attack) not sure how calculating a “to-hit” would work but 

armor and defense should be separated maybe works similarly to lancer for health and stuff idfk

would play similarly to armored core or something with lots of movement and direction switching

no opportunity attacks etc   

maybe have attacks auto hit and have defender have to spend leftover dice in their pool to dodge

probably would be gridless but hex grid would work. Hex bases for facing (probably just copy alpha strike)

weapon ammunition types would be important lasers are like the basic one average everything (maybe smoke countermeasures can block laser damage or mitigate it) 

ballistic weapons have longer range and ammo limitations 

plasma weapons have to have dice allocated to them before the movement and shooting phases take place, but melt armor 

melee weapons automatically destroy any limb they hit but it should be hard to successfully get into melee without being fast, which means you are squishy

maybe rail guns could be a subset of ballistic weapons

movement would occur by allocating dice then taking turns spending 1 dice at a time to move

meaning light mechs naturally have better “initiative” due to the ability to have more movement dice allocated

the game would be focused on strategy and resource allocation based on allocating dice to a pool then spending it, but you lose any dice you don’t spend after allocating

so if you allocate 2 dice to move but only use 1 for some reason you just lose the extra dice

allow mechs with hands to pull trees out of the ground and whack a mf with it

Missiles should be a sort of zoning tool that force enemy pilots to reserve dice for evasion. Can be auto-dodged with evasion dice but also deal a lot of damage.
