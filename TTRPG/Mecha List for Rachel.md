**Just to preface: I am writing this assuming you know next to nothing about Mecha, and will do my best to explain the differences. As well, as much as I would like the claim the ground of a (all encompassing) *Mecha Fan*, I am much more attached to and biased towards Real Robot, and therefore know more about it. So my list will be HEAVILY biased towards said Real Robot.**

>[!note] 
>For reference, I will be separating Mobile Suit Gundam shows into each individual show, as Gundam varies quite heavily based on the show, with **Turn A** being very obviously Super Robot, while **08th MS Team** and **0079** (the original) are very Real Robot, and something like **The Witch from Mercury** and **Unicorn** finding themselves somewhere in the middle.

## The Difference between Eastern and Western Mecha.

There is a distinction between Eastern and Western Mecha, as the core design philosophy is different (although there are exceptions to everything, and sometimes it can just be the fact that one mech design is from eastern media and another is from western media, its kinda dumb lol). Eastern Mecha generally follow a more "humanoid" design scheme, with bipedal mechs that have functioning hands with fingers, heads, and human proportions. Western Mecha design takes a far more grounded "Tank with Legs" approach to Mecha design, With big, beefy legs supporting an upper body and arms that sometimes are just guns strapped to the side of the torso, or mounted on arms but built into the forearm and not located in a hand.

# Real Robot

>[!note]
>"Real Robot" is one of the two overarching "Genres" of Mecha. both have very self-explanatory titles, with Real Robot being the first. It tends to follow a more grounded story about Some Guy and his Funny Robot in a realistic war. (see OG Gundam, the 1 Year War literally just being over the difference in rights between Earthians and Spacians, and Zeon being a fairly good representation of an extremist regime.) While it doesn't explicitly mean that the tech in the setting is more "realistic", it does mean that the robots will Generally follow the rules of gravity n shit.

# Super Robot

>[!note]
>"Super Robot" shows traditionally are the Marvel of the Mecha world. They follow much less constrained logic and allow for awesome things such as Joy and Whimsy within my stupid depression genre. Almost every mech in Super Robot is strictly humanoid, and follows all the cool cartoon logic of transformation sequences and the Power Of Friendship. But, as with all things there are exceptions. Super Robot can also be shows that arent explicitly Real Robot, or Real Robot adjacent stuff like Evangelion, which would be Real Robot if it didn't have AT Fields and the fact that the Eva's are Angels, or Gundam Unicorn, where Psycho Frames allow for the pilots emotions to influence the Mecha's power and do some Power Of Friendship Type Shit (the power of Lesbians in Witch from Mercury's case).
